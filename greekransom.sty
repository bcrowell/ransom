% Font and style stuff to provide a Greek font, bold Greek, and a latin font that looks good with the Greek one.

\setmainfont{GFS Didot} % is said to be a good Latin font to match with Porson-style fonts; if changing this, change it on the following line as well
\newfontfamily\latinfont{GFS Didot}
\newfontfamily\greekfont{GFS Porson}
%  Also tried GFS Olga, which is also a Porson-style font; has a higher x-height than GFS Porson, and therefore matches better with Latin fonts.
%  Note that GFS Porson doesn't have a glyph for B7, ano teleia, but does have 387, which is also ano teleia.
\newenvironment{greek}{\greekfont}{}
\newenvironment{latin}{\latinfont}{}
% Both Olga and Porson lack real bold:
\newenvironment{boldgreek}{\fontspec{GFS Olga}[FakeBold=0.1]}{} % discontinuous behavior: 0.0 gives no bolding, 0.0001 gives quite a bit
