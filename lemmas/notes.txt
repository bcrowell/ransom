=== about the data ===
based on project perseus data
project perseus has an unclear license; homepage says cc-by-sa, but file itself says nc; did they change licenses?

I have code that generates both a json file and an sdbm file.
I commented out the code to generate the sdbm file, because it's super huge, and
reading the json file is actually pretty efficient.

The file homer_lemmas.json is created by to_db.rb, and comments in that program
define its format.
File tlg0012.tlg001.perseus-grc1.tb.xml starts with Iliad book 1.
Subdocs are sorted in string order, so book 10 comes before book 2.
This file seems to contain the whole Iliad.
tlg0012.tlg001 = Iliad (see https://github.com/PerseusDL/canonical-greekLit/blob/master/data/tlg0012/tlg001/tlg0012.tlg001.perseus-eng3.xml )
tlg0012.tlg002 = Odyssey (see https://github.com/PerseusDL/canonical-greekLit/blob/master/data/tlg0012/tlg001/tlg0012.tlg001.perseus-eng3.xml )
in file tlg0012.tlg001.perseus-grc1.tb.xml
    <sentence subdoc="2.217" id="2274577" document_id="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.perseus-grc1">
... this refers to Iliad 2.217
      <word id="6" form="οὐλομένην" lemma="οὐλόμενος" postag="a-s---fa-" head="1" relation="ATR" cite="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:1.2"/>
...the 1.2 is book and line
