A presentation of foreign-language texts in which the text is on a left page and
glosses are shown in corresponding geometrical positions on the right page.

Although the software is designed to be fairly general, my initial use case
is a presentation of the Iliad.

## Card decks for Mnemosyne

The front of each card is an inflected word from the appropriate book of the Iliad,
and the back is the word's English translation and its grammatical
information. For example, if the front is ἔχωμεν, then the back is
ἔχω, have, present 1 pl. subjunctive. The deck includes all words from
that book except for those that are extremely common (such as articles)
or extremely uncommon (an inflected form occurring only once or twice
in all of Homer). Most cards have additional information on the back,
such as etymology, cognates, genitives of nouns, and the first few
principal parts of verbs.
