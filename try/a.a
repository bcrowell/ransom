\comm{The Gospel of Mark is likely the first written biographical material about Jesus,\footnote{The Pauline epistles were probably 10-20 years
earlier, but assume their audience (mostly gentile and illiterate) is already familiar with basic facts about the life of Jesus.}
and it begins not with a description of Jesus but of John the Baptist.
We know nothing reliable about John's birthplace or date of birth. Luke, in the course of a miraculous birth story, claims that
John came from a priestly family:}

\luke{1:5}{There was in the days of Herod [the Great], the king of Judea, a certain priest named Zacharias [John's father], of the priestly division of Abijah.}

\comm{
John was a great celebrity of his time and place, meriting a long passage in
Josephus (much longer than the brief mention of Jesus\footnote{Antiquities of the Jews 20-9;
excluding the likely forgery in 18-3}). 
Josephus says:\footnote{Antiquities 18-5-2} % https://www.gutenberg.org/files/2848/2848-h/2848-h.htm#link182HCH0005
}\index{Josephus!mission of John the Baptist}

\begin{quotetext}\index[texts]{Josephus}\label{josephus-baptism}
Now some of the Jews thought that the destruction of Herod [Antipater]'s army [ca.~36 CE, by the Nabateans] came
from God, and that very justly, as a punishment of what he did against
John, that was called the Baptist: for Herod slew him, who was a good
man, and commanded the Jews to exercise virtue, both as to
righteousness towards one another, and piety towards God, and so to
come to baptism;\footnote{The Greek verbs βάπτω and βαπτίζω have meanings such as ``to dip,'' ``to be immersed,'' or
``to sink, go under.'' Baptism, βάπτισμα, is a neologism that is not recorded before the time of John and Jesus.}
for that the washing [with water] would be acceptable
to him, if they made use of it, not in order to the forgiveness of sin,\footnote{Josephus contradicts Mark 1:4.
The contradictions show that authority to forgive sin was a cultural sore point.}
but for the purification of the body; supposing still that the soul was thoroughly purified beforehand
by righteousness.\label{josephus-forgiveness}
\end{quotetext}

\comm{\index{baptism}\index{John the Baptist!baptism rite}
Josephus had himself in fact been a follower of a similar ascetic:
}

\begin{quotetext}\index[texts]{Josephus}
And when I was
about sixteen years old, I had a mind to [try on for size] the several sects
that were among us. These sects are three:-- The first is that of the
Pharisees, the second that Sadducees, and the third that of the Essens,
as we have frequently told you; for I thought that by this means I might
choose the best, if I were once acquainted with them all; so I contented
myself with hard fare, and underwent great difficulties, and went
through them all. Nor did I content myself with these trials only; but
when I was informed that one, whose name was Banus, lived in the desert,
and used no other clothing than grew upon trees, and had no other food
than what grew of its own accord, and bathed himself in cold water
frequently, both by night and by day, in order to preserve his chastity,
I imitated him in those things, and continued with him three years.
So when I had accomplished my desires, I returned back to the city,
being now nineteen years old, and began to conduct myself according to
the rules of the sect of the Pharisees, which is of kin to the sect of
the Stoics, as the Greeks call them.

\comm{
Josephus was a Jerusalemite of priestly ancestry, who fought against the Romans,
was enslaved by them and then freed, worked for them as a translator, and finally became a Roman citizen.
We can see that he is a knowledgeable informant about this type of dissident movement, and also that it
was not unusual to find men of John and Jesus's types in their time and place. As seen by their contemporaries,
they were unexceptional characters straight from central casting: a wilderness baptizer and a false messiah.
Josephus's description of the significance of the baptism ritual may also be
sanitized in order to comport with Josephus's sympathies
with the Roman-Jewish regime. Matthew, Mark, and Luke give descriptions that include symbolic details omitted by Josephus,
and possibly also social teachings that go beyond the kind of personal spiritual seeking described by Josephus.
}

\gospelmark{1:4}{John came baptizing in the wilderness and preaching the
baptism of repentance for forgiveness of sins.  All the country of
Judea and all those of Jerusalem went out to him. They were baptized
by him in the Jordan river, confessing their sins.}

\comm{
John's actions and the symbolism of the Jordan were extremely politically provocative both to Rome and to
to the Judean client regime and its centralized theocracy at the Temple in Jerusalem.\note{john-provocative}.
Unlike Jesus, who operated only in Galilee except at the very end of his life, John is described
as preaching to the Judeans. His preaching was probably in Perea,\index{Perea} in the southern trans-Jordan.\footnote{His execution
by Herod Antipas means that he was within his jurisdiction, which covered Galilee and Perea. To attract large
numbers of people from Jerusalem to the eastern side of the Jordan, he would have had to be in Perea rather than Galilee.
John 3:23 identifies one location as ``Aenon near Salim,'' for which several locations have been proposed.}
}

\comm{
Mark describes John as an ascetic:\note{john-ascetic}
}

\gospelmark{1:6}{John was clothed with camel's hair and a leather belt around his waist. He ate locusts
and wild honey.}


\comm{
The costume is designed to evoke the prophet Elijah (\reftex{2 Kings 1:8}), and many people
express confusion about whether John literally is a reincarnation of Elijah.
Matthew, unlike Mark, has John prefiguring Jesus's mission by saying
in addition,
}

\matthew{3:2}{``Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand!''}

\comm{
and hurling abuse directly in the face of the priestly class as a ``brood of vipers'' (3:7). We don't
know whether John's message was actually so explicitly antiestablishment,
but the apocalypticism would make sense in terms of the prophetic significance of the Elijah costume:
}

\bible{Malachi 4:5}{Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the great and terrible day of Yahweh comes.}

\comm{
Luke recounts further social teachings of John (likely inauthentic \note{john-social}):\label{john-social}
}

\luke{3:10}{The multitudes asked him, ``What then must we do?''
 He answered them, ``He who has two coats, let him give to him who has none. He who has food, let him do likewise.''
 Tax collectors also came to be baptized, and they said to him, ``Teacher, what must we do?''
 He said to them, ``Collect no more than that which is appointed to you.''
 Soldiers also asked him, saying, ``What about us? What must we do?''
He said to them, ``Extort from no one by violence, neither accuse anyone wrongfully. Be content with your wages.''}

\comm{
Josephus continues with the story of John's doom:\footnote{Mark's account of John's death is fantastical.
Incidentally, Mark also refers to Herod as a king, whereas actually he was a tetrach. Matthew corrects
this in most places, but misses making the correction in 14:9. Mark Goodacre proposes this type of
editorial fatigue as good evidence that Matthew based his gospel on Mark's.}
}\index{John the Baptist!death}\label{john-the-baptist-death}\index{Josephus!death of John the Baptist}

\begin{quotetext}\index[texts]{Josephus}
Now when [many] others came in crowds about him, for
they were very greatly moved [or pleased] by hearing his words, Herod,
who feared lest the great influence John had over the people might put
it into his power and inclination to raise a rebellion, [for they
seemed ready to do any thing he should advise,] thought it best, by
putting him to death, to prevent any mischief he might cause, and not
bring himself into difficulties, by sparing a man who might make him
repent of it when it would be too late. Accordingly he was sent a
prisoner, out of Herod's suspicious temper, to Macherus, the castle I
before mentioned, and was there put to death [around 30 CE]. Now the Jews had an
opinion that the destruction of this army was sent as a punishment
upon Herod, and a mark of God's displeasure to him.
\end{quotetext}

\comm{
John was believed by some to have been the messiah, and he retained a body of followers for
generations after his death.

\begin{section}{Jesus's origins and early life}

\comm{
Mark, John, and Paul ignore the question of Jesus's birth.\footnote{Luke and Matthew provide stories of a miraculous birth,
along with a ``massacre of the innocents'' (\reftex{Matthew 2:16}).} Embedded in the miraculous birth stories of Matthew and Luke is the statement
that he is an oldest son,\footnote{But Chilton hypothesizes that his brothers were older.} born (ca.~4 BCE) in
very humble circumstances.
}

\luke{2:7}{[Mary] gave birth to her firstborn son. She wrapped him in bands of cloth and laid him in a manger\ldots}\index{Mary}

\matthew{1:18}{\ldots After his mother, Mary, was promised in marriage\footnote{μνηστευθείσης} to Joseph, before they came together, she was found pregnant by the holy spirit.}

% https://logeion.uchicago.edu/%CE%BC%CE%BD%CE%B7%CF%83%CF%84%CE%B5%CF%8D%CF%89

\comm{
A typical age for a newly married woman was about 13.\footnote{Chilton, ``Rabbi Jesus: an intimate biography,'' p.~6}
Working from naturalistic assumptions, Matthew's description means that Jesus was what we used to call in twentieth-century American
culture an illegitimate child.
In his own culture's conceptual world, he was considered a \emph{mamzer},\footnote{Chilton} which doesn't have to do with marriage but means someone born from forbidden sex.
A mamzer was part of a marginalized social class.
The skeptical Nazareans later scornfully recount the background of this uppity local boy (\note{family-interp}):
}

\gospelmark{6:2}{``What is the wisdom that is given to this man, that such
mighty works come about by his hands? Isn't this the manual laborer, the
son of Mary\footnote{They insult Jesus by referring to him as Mary's son. As the eldest brother, he should be referred to as Joseph's son.
The implication is that he is illegitimate. Aslan, p.~37; Hill, p.~163.} and brother of James, Joses, Judah, and Simon? Aren't his
sisters here with us?'' So they were offended at him.}\label{jesus-paternity}

\comm{
Regardless of whether Jesus was conceived miraculously, he was perceived within his community as illegitimate. Pharisees
debating Jesus say:
}

\john{8:41}{\label{john-illegitimacy}
``We were not born of sexual immorality. We have one Father, God.''
}

\matthew{1:19}{
Joseph, her husband, being a righteous man, and not willing to make her a public example, intended to divorce her secretly.
}

\comm{
Mary's husband Joseph is mostly absent in the gospels, and entirely so once Jesus is an adult, which suggests that he was mostly absent in Jesus's life.
Descriptions of Jesus's family relations generally fail to mention Joseph. For example, Joseph is the only member
of Jesus's immediate family who is not present at a mourning gathering in Jerusalem (possibly in the same room where the
last supper had occurred):
}

\bible{Acts 1:14}{
All these [the eleven remaining messengers] with one accord continued steadfastly in prayer and supplication, along with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers.
}

\comm{
Jerome hypothesized that Joseph died when Jesus was young. There is no record that Jesus ever married, which would have been
anomalous for a man of his age except that, as a mamzer, he was forbidden from marrying most Jewish women, the exceptions being other marginalized
classes such as mamzers, converts to Judaism, and freed slaves.
Josephus (Antiquities 20-9-1) confirms that Jesus has a brother James, who was later to become the movement's main leader
in Jerusalem \note{james}:\index{James, brother of Jesus}\index{Josephus!Jesus and James}
}

\comm{
Jesus grew up in the tiny village of Nazareth,\note{nazareth} in Galilee,\note{jesus-galilee} speaking Aramaic.\note{jesus-aramaic}
He probably never learned to read (\note{literacy}), but he must have had an opportunity
at least to hear an oral Aramaic version (targum) of the Jewish bible, hear to psalms sung, and to receive
instruction from John the Baptist.\index{Nazareth}

At the three yearly great festivals, Jews in the Holy Land were theoretically obligated to
travel to Jerusalem, where they gathered in great crowds at the Temple:
}

\luke{2:41}{His parents went every year to Jeru\-salem at the feast of the Passover.  When he was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem according to the custom of the feast;  and when they had fulfilled the days, as they were returning, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem. Joseph and his mother didn't know it,  but supposing him to be in the company, they went a day's journey; and they looked for him among their relatives and acquaintances.  When they didn't find him, they returned to Jerusalem, looking for him.  After three days they found him in the Temple, sitting in the middle of the teachers, both listening to them and asking them questions.  All who heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers.  When they saw him, they were astonished; and his mother said to him, ``Son, why have you treated us this way? Behold, your father and I\footnote{In some manuscripts,
this was altered by scribes who didn't like the implication that Joseph
was Jesus's father.} were anxiously looking for you.''
 He said to them, ``Why were you looking for me? Didn't you know that I must be in my Father's house?''}

\comm{
This miracle story is a Christian fabrication (as shown by the three days, which are Christian symbolism),
but it may preserve a factual picture of a precocious child getting an education against all odds, or
it may be that Jesus gained his education as a teenager or an adult, like Frederick Douglass. }

\comm{The gospels leap
over Jesus's youth and young adulthood to ca.~28 CE, when Jesus would have been about 31.
}

\luke{3:1}{Now in the fifteenth year of the reign [14-37 CE] of Tiberius
Caesar\ldots the word of God came to John, the son of Zacharias, in
the wilderness.  He came into all the region around the Jordan,
preaching the baptism of repentance for remission of sins.}

\comm{
Among John's followers were a number of people who were later to become the early Christians.
One of the few things we can know securely about the historical Jesus is that he was baptized
by John:
}

\gospelmark{1:9}{In those days, Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized by John in the Jordan.}\index{baptism!of Jesus by John}

\comm{The gospels describe this baptism in ways that seem like attempts to rewrite history and make Jesus rather than John the master,
which would be contrary to the historical evidence that John was the much more important and well known figure during the two mens' lifetimes.
Jesus's baptism is also attended by a supernatural appearance by God, which doesn't meet my criteria for inclusion \note{in-you-i-am-well-pleased}.}

\comm{Others baptized by John
include Simon Peter, messenger and founder of the Church (p.~\pageref{peter-called}), and his brother, the messenger Andrew (John 1:40);
 as well as more who are described in Acts:}\index{John the Baptist!followers}

\bible{Acts 19:1}{While Apollos [an Alexandrian Jew who was a follower of John and then converted in Acts 18] was at Corinth, Paul, having passed through the upper country, came to Ephesus and found certain students. He said to them, “Did you receive the holy spirit when you believed?”
They said to him, ``No, we haven't even heard that there is a holy spirit.''
 He said, ``Into what then were you baptized?''
They said, ``Into John's baptism.''
 Paul said, ``John indeed baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying to the people that they should believe in the one who would come after him, that is, in Christ Jesus.''
 When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the lord Jesus.}

\comm{
All the gospels agree that Jesus gathered male and female followers and created his
own knock-off of John's illicit knock-off of the Temple's rites.
There was some kind of  competition and splintering.
Many of John's followers remained faithful to him long after his death, and the synoptic gospels
only describe Jesus as scavenging John's followers after John's death.
But the gospel of John, which in general disagrees completely with the synoptics on chronology, describes this as beginning
even while John was alive, first in John 1:35-45, and later:}

\john{3:22}{
\ldots Jesus came with his students into the land of Judea. He stayed there with them and baptized.   John also was baptizing in Enon near Salim, because there was much water there. They came and were baptized;   for John was not yet thrown into prison.   Therefore a dispute arose on the part of John's students with some Jews about purification.   They came to John and said to him, ``Rabbi, he who was with you beyond the Jordan, to whom you have testified, behold, he baptizes, and everyone is coming to him.''\footnote{The evangelist immediately follows this up with John the Baptist papering over
the dispute, in a passage that doesn't meet my criteria for inclusion \notewithoutbackref{about-this-doc}.}
}

\comm{The plausible historical sequence of events\note{jtb-sequence} is that John is executed by Herod Antipas, leaving his student Jesus lost and confused,
after which Jesus goes on a solitary vision quest:}

\gospelmark{1:12}{Immediately the Spirit drove [Jesus] out into the
wilderness. He was there in the wild\-erness forty days, tempted by
Satan. He was with the wild animals; and the angels were serving him.\footnote{\reftex{Luke 4} has a lengthier account of
the temptation, with the devil offering Jesus worldly power. \personal{This is unlikely to have any connection to
Jesus's actual visions and spiritual experiences. It sounds more like the later sanitizing of the early
Christian religion for consumption by Romans, who did not want to be part of a religion that preached the overthrow
of the empire.}}}

\gospelmark{1:14}{ Now after John was arrested, Jesus came
into Galilee, preaching the good news of God's kingdom, and saying,
``The time is fulfilled, and God's kingdom is at hand! Repent, and

\luke{4:14}{Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee, and news about him spread through all the surrounding area. \ldots
  He came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up.\footnote{Luke places this near the beginning of Jesus's activities in Galilee,
Mark at the end.}}

\gospelmark{6:1}{
When the sabbath had come, he began to teach in the synagogue,\footnote{Both Luke and Mark  set the scene at a synagogue, although
it's not actually clear how realistic it is to imagine that Nazareth
would have had a synagogue. Luke \reftex{4:16-21} has Jesus reading from a scroll ``as was his custom'' and teaching about Elijah and
Isaiah, with messianic implications. As a mamzer, Jesus is actually not even supposed to speak in a synagogue.} and many hearing him were astonished, saying, ``Where did this man get these things?'' and, ``What is the wisdom that is given to this man, that such mighty works come about by his hands?   Isn't this the carpenter, the son of Mary and brother of James, Joses, Judah, and Simon? Aren't his sisters here with us?'' So they were offended at him.\footnote{Jesus's listeners refer to his questionable paternity (p.~\pageref{jesus-paternity}). Why is this mamzer lecturing us? Jesus reacts angrily and ups the ante by declaring himself a prophet.}

Jesus said to them, ``A prophet is not without honor, except in his own country, and among his own relatives, and in his own house.''   He could do no mighty work there, except that he laid his hands on a few sick people and healed them.   He marveled because of their unbelief.
}


\luke{4:23}{
He said to them, ``Doubtless you will tell me this proverb, `Physician, heal yourself!\footnote{I.e., people have challenged Jesus by saying
that although he claims to be able to cure crazy people, they think he himself is crazy.}
 Whatever we have heard done at Capernaum, do also here in your hometown.'{}''   He said, ``Most certainly I tell you, no prophet is acceptable 
in his hometown.''\index{prophet in his own country}\footnote{Jesus explains his lack of healing power in his hometown to be a punishment for
its refusal to accept him as a propet. Luke \reftex{4:25} then has Jesus continue his diatribe with a passage that
manipulates scripture (Chilton, p.~99) in order to imply that Jesus is not only a prophet but the messiah, sent by Elijah, and that
the messiah's mission is also to the gentiles--all of which is Luke's agenda (Funk, p.~280).}
}

\comm{Luke, unlike Mark, finishes the scene with an escalation of the conflict and the Nazareans trying to execute Jesus (\reftex{Luke 4:28}), apparently for the crime of false prophecy \note{false-prophecy-executation}, but this has the hallmarks of a garbled elaboration (\notewithoutbackref{garbled-endings}).}

\subhead{Extending the torah}
\matthew{5:17}{
``Don't think that I came to destroy the scripture.\footnote{Ο νόμος καὶ οἱ προφῆται, literally ``the law and the prophets.''
The inexact Greek word νόμος, ``law,'' as well as terms like ``walk'' (Mark 7:5) and ``allow,'' are used by the evangelists
to mean several things, including the torah, the halakhah or legalistic aspects of the torah, or laws and customs in the ordinary
sense. The set phrase used here means the torah plus the remainder
of the Hebrew bible, i.e., the Hebrew bible or tanakh in its entirety. We don't know whether the tanakh was
entirely canonicalized by Jesus's lifetime.} I didn't come to destroy, but to fulfill.    For most certainly, I tell you, until heaven and earth pass away, not even one smallest letter or one tiny pen stroke shall in any way pass away from the torah, until all things are accomplished.    Therefore, whoever shall break one of these least commandments and teach others to do so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever shall do and teach them shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.    For I tell you that unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, there is no way you will enter into the kingdom of heaven.

   ``You have heard that it was said to the ancient ones, `You shall not murder;' and `Whoever murders will be in danger of the judgment.'    But I tell you that everyone who is angry with his brother without a cause  will be in danger of the judgment. Whoever says to his brother, `Raca!' will be in danger of the council. Whoever says, `You fool!' will be in danger of the fire of Gehenna.

   ``If therefore you are offering your gift at the altar, and there remember that your brother has anything against you,    leave your gift there before the altar, and go your way. First be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift.    Agree with your adversary quickly while you are with him on the way; lest perhaps the prosecutor deliver you to the judge, and the judge deliver you to the officer, and you be cast into prison.    Most certainly I tell you, you shall by no means get out of there until you have paid the last penny.

   ``You have heard that it was said,  `You shall not commit adultery;'    but I tell you that everyone who gazes at a woman to lust after her has committed adultery with her already in his heart.    If your right eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out and throw it away from you. For it is more profitable for you that one of your members should perish than for your whole body to be cast into Gehenna.    If your right hand causes you to stumble, cut it off, and throw it away from you. For it is more profitable for you that one of your members should perish, than for your whole body to be cast into Gehenna.

   ``It was also said, `Whoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorce,'    but I tell you that whoever puts away his wife, except for the cause of sexual immorality, makes her an adulteress; and whoever marries her when she is put away commits adultery.

   ``Again you have heard that it was said to the ancient ones, `You shall not make false vows, but shall perform to the lord your vows,'    but I tell you, don't swear at all: neither by heaven, for it is the throne of God;    nor by the earth, for it is the footstool of his feet; nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King.    Neither shall you swear by your head, for you can't make one hair white or black.    But let your `Yes' be `Yes' and your `No' be `No.' Whatever is more than these is of the evil one.

   ``You have heard that it was said, `An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.'    But I tell you, don't resist him who is evil; but whoever strikes you on your right cheek, turn to him the other also.    If anyone sues you to take away your coat, let him have your cloak also.    Whoever compels you to go one mile, go with him two.    Give to him who asks you, and don't turn away him who desires to borrow from you.

   ``You have heard that it was said, `You shall love your neighbor  and hate your enemy.'    But I tell you, love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who mistreat you and persecute you,    that you may be children of your Father who is in heaven. For he makes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the just and the unjust.    For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Don't even the tax collectors do the same?    If you only greet your friends, what more do you do than others? Don't even the tax collectors do the same?    Therefore you shall be perfect, just as your Father in heaven is perfect.

Therefore I tell you, don't be anxious about your life: what you will eat, or what you will drink; nor yet for your body, what you will wear. Isn't life more than food, and the body more than clothing?    See the birds of the sky, that they don't sow, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns. Your heavenly Father feeds them. Aren't you of much more value than they?

   ``Which of you by being anxious, can add one moment to his lifespan?    Why are you anxious about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow. They don't toil, neither do they spin,    yet I tell you that even Solomon in all his glory was not dressed like one of these.    But if God so clothes the grass of the field, which today exists and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, won't he much more clothe you, you of little faith?

   ``Therefore don't be anxious, saying, `What will we eat?', `What will we drink?' or, `What will we wear?'    For the gentiles seek after all these things; for your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things.    But seek first God's kingdom and his righteousness; and all these things will be given to you as well.    Therefore don't be anxious\footnote{The verb μεριμνάω can also mean simply ``to care about,''

radical command to ``take no thought for the morrow.''} for tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself. Each day's own evil is sufficient.

   ``Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly are ravening wolves.    By their fruits you will know them. Do you gather grapes from thorns or figs from thistles?    Even so, every good tree produces good fruit, but the corrupt tree produces evil fruit.    A good tree can't produce evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree produce good fruit.

Then [after the commissioning of the messengers] he came into a house.   The multitude came together again, so that they could not so much as eat bread.   When his family\footnote{or friends; lit.~``those belonging to him''} heard it, they went out to seize him; for they said, ``He is insane.''   The scribes who came down from Jerusalem said, ``He has Beelzebul,'' and, ``By the prince of the demons he casts out the demons.''

   Again he began to teach by the seaside. A great multitude was gathered to him, so that he entered into a boat in the sea and sat down. All the multitude were on the land by the sea.   He taught them many things in parables, and told them in his teaching,    ``Listen! Behold, the farmer went out to sow.    As he sowed, some seed fell by the road, and the birds came and devoured it.    Others fell on the rocky ground, where it had little soil, and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of soil.    When the sun had risen, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away.    Others fell among the thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked it, and it yielded no fruit.    Others fell into the good ground and yielded fruit, growing up and increasing. Some produced thirty times, some sixty times, and some one hundred times as much.''   
He said, ``Whoever has ears to hear, let him hear.''\footnote{This is a stock phrase like ``The End,'' to let a listener know the story
is over, or to serve a similar marking function in the written text, which was originally WRITTENINALLCAPSWITHNOSPACES. It may have been
a cultural cliche rather than an idiosyncracy of Jesus: Funk, p.~54.}

  When he was alone, those who were around him with the twelve asked him about the parables.   He said to them, ``To you is given the mystery of God's kingdom, but to those who are outside, all things are done in parables,    that `seeing they may see and not perceive, and hearing they may hear and not understand, lest perhaps they should turn again, and their sins should be forgiven them.'{}''

  He said to them, ``Don't you understand this parable? How will you understand all of the parables?    The farmer sows the word.    The ones by the road are the ones where the word is sown; and when they have heard, immediately Satan comes and takes away the word which has been sown in them.    These in the same way are those who are sown on the rocky places, who, when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with joy.    They have no root in themselves, but are short-lived. When oppression or persecution arises because of the word, immediately they stumble.    Others are those who are sown among the thorns. These are those who have heard the word,    and the cares of this age, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.    Those which were sown on the good ground are those who hear the word, accept it, and bear fruit, some thirty times, some sixty times, and some one hundred times.''}

  He said to them, ``Take heed what you hear. With whatever measure you measure, it will be measured to you; and more will be given to you who hear.    For whoever has, to him more will be given; and he who doesn't have, even that which he has will be taken away from him.''

  He said, ``God's kingdom is as if a man should cast seed on the earth,    and should sleep and rise night and day, and the seed should spring up and grow, though he doesn't know how.    For the earth bears fruit by itself: first the blade, then the ear, then the full grain in the ear.    But when the fruit is ripe, immediately he puts in the sickle, because the harvest has come.''

  He said, ``How will we liken God's kingdom? Or with what parable will we illustrate it?    It's like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, though it is less than all the seeds that are on the earth,    yet when it is sown, grows up and becomes greater than all the herbs, and puts out great branches, so that the birds of the sky can lodge under its shadow.''

  With many such parables he spoke the word to them, as they were able to hear it.   Without a parable he didn't speak to them; but privately to his own students he explained everything.

  On that day, when evening had come, he said to them, ``Let's go over to the other side.''   Leaving the multitude, they took him with them, even as he was, in the boat. Other small boats were also with him.   A big wind storm arose, and the waves beat into the boat, so much that the boat was already filled.   He himself was in the stern, asleep on the cushion; and they woke him up and asked him, ``Teacher, don't you care that we are dying?''

  He awoke and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, ``Peace! Be still!'' The wind ceased and there was a great calm.   He said to them, ``Why are you so afraid? How is it that you have no faith?''

  They were greatly afraid and said to one another, ``Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?''

Nobody could bind him any more, not even with chains,   because he had been often bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been torn apart by him, and the fetters broken in pieces. Nobody had the strength to tame him.   Always, night and day, in the tombs and in the mountains, he was crying out, and cutting himself with stones.

Behold, one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name, came; and seeing him, he fell at his feet   and begged him much, saying, ``My little daughter is at the point of death. Please come and lay your hands on her, that she may be made healthy, and live.''

  He went with him, and a great multitude followed him, and they pressed upon him on all sides.   A certain woman who had a discharge of blood for twelve years,   and had suffered many things by many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was no better, but rather grew worse,   having heard the things concerning Jesus, came up behind him in the crowd and touched his clothes.   For she said, ``If I just touch his clothes, I will be made well.''   Immediately the flow of her blood was dried up, and she felt in her body that she was healed of her affliction.

  Immediately Jesus, perceiving in himself that the power had gone out from him, turned around in the crowd and asked, ``Who touched my clothes?''

  His students said to him, ``You see the multitude pressing against you, and you say, `Who touched me?'{}''

  He looked around to see her who had done this thing.   But the woman, fearing and trembling, knowing what had been done to her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth.

  He said to her, ``Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace, and be cured of your disease.''

  While he was still speaking, people came from the synagogue ruler's house, saying, ``Your daughter is dead. Why bother the Teacher any more?''

  But Jesus, when he heard the message spoken, immediately said to the ruler of the synagogue, ``Don't be afraid, only believe.''   He allowed no one to follow him except Peter, James, and John the brother of James.   He came to the synagogue ruler's house, and he saw an uproar, weeping, and great wailing.   When he had entered in, he said to them, ``Why do you make an uproar and weep? The child is not dead, but is asleep.''

  They ridiculed him. But he, having put them all out, took the father of the child, her mother, and those who were with him, and went in where the child was lying.   Taking the child by the hand, he said to her, ``Talitha cumi!'' which means, being interpreted, ``Girl, I tell you, get up!''   Immediately the girl rose up and walked, for she was twelve years old. They were amazed with great amazement.   He strictly ordered them that no one should know this, and commanded that something should be given to her to eat.}

\bible{Didache 9}{
Now concerning the giving of thanks,\footnote{τῆς εὐχαριστίας, hence  ``eucharist''} give thanks this way. First, concerning the cup:
We thank you, our father, for the holy vine of your servant David, which you made known to us through your servant Jesus.
Glory to you forever.

And concerning the broken bread:
We thank you, our father, for the life and knowledge which you made known to us through your servant Jesus.
Glory to you forever.
Even as this broken bread was scattered over the hills, and was gathered together and became one, so let
your church be gathered together from the ends of the earth into your kingdom, for your is the glory and the power through Jesus Christ 
forever.\footnote{Didache 9 continues with a prohibition against offering the eucharist to those who haven't been baptized,
citing Jesus's words, ``Don't give that which is holy to the dogs.'' In Matthew 7:6 this probably means not to spread the
mission to the gentiles, so the Didache has changed the exclusion of gentiles into the exclusion of the unbaptized.
In general, we don't know whether Matthew draws from
the Didache (as argued controversially by Garrow), the Didache from Matthew, both, or neither (but with both drawing from some
source such as Q).}

\bible{Didache 10}{
But after you are filled, give thanks this way:

We thank you, holy father, for your holy name which you caused to
dwell in our hearts, and for the knowledge and faith and
immortality, which you made known to us through your servant Jesus.
Glory to you forever. You, master almighty, created all
things for your name's sake. You gave food and drink to men for
enjoyment, that they might give thanks to you. But to us you
freely gave spiritual food and drink and life eternal through your
servant. Before all things we thank you that you are mighty.

  Jesus said to him, ``Most certainly I tell you that you today, even this night, before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times.''

\comm{Pontius Pilate is described by the Jewish  historians Philo and Josephus. Factoring out their vitriolic sentiments,
the general portrait they paint of him is
of a Roman ruler who is manipulative but not venal, measured in his violence, and loyal to Rome.
He is chauvinistic toward the Jews, and would have overseen many routine crucifixions. The following extract is
from a letter, recorded by Philo, from the Jewish king Agrippa I. The incident it records, which probably happened right around
the time of Jesus's crucifixion, is typical
of Pilate's recorded interactions with the Jews of Jerusalem.}

\begin{quotetext}\index[texts]{Philo}
Pilate was one of the emperor's lieutenants, having been appointed
governor of Judaea. He, not more with the object of doing honour to
Tiberius than with that of vexing the multitude, dedicated some gilt
shields in the palace of Herod, in the holy city; which had no form
nor any other forbidden thing represented on them except some
necessary inscription, which mentioned these two facts, the name of
the person who had placed them there, and the person in whose honour
they were so placed there.\footnote{They probably included the inscription ``son of divine Augustus,'' meaning Tiberius.} 

But when the multitude heard what had been
done, and when the circumstance became notorious, then the people,
putting forward the four sons of the king, who were in no respect
inferior to the kings themselves, in fortune or in rank, and his other
descendants, and those magistrates who were among them at the time,
entreated him to alter and to rectify the innovation which he had
committed in respect of the shields; and not to make any alteration in
their national customs, which had hitherto been preserved without any
interruption, without being in the least degree changed by any king of
emperor.

But when he steadfastly refused this petition (for he was a
man of a very inflexible disposition, and very merciless as well as
very obstinate), they cried out: ``Do not cause a sedition; do not make
war upon us; do not destroy the peace which exists. The honour of the
emperor is not identical with dishonour to the ancient laws; let it
not be to you a pretence for heaping insult on our nation. Tiberius is
not desirous that any of our laws or customs shall be destroyed. And
if you yourself say that he is, show us either some command from him,
or some letter, or something of the kind, that we, who have been sent
to you as ambassadors, may cease to trouble you, and may address our
supplications to your master.''

They began to salute him, ``Hail, King of the Jews!''   They struck his head with a reed and spat on him, and bowing their knees, did homage to him.   When they had mocked him, they took the purple cloak off him, and put his own garments on him. They led him out to crucify him.

  They compelled a man passing by, coming from the country, Simon of Cyrene, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to go with them that he might bear his cross.   They brought him to the place called Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, ``The place of a skull.''   They offered him wine mixed with myrrh to drink, but he didn't take it.\footnote{\reftex{Mark 15:24} has the soldiers casting lots for Jesus's clothes. This is probably a detail fabricated

  At noon, darkness came over the whole land until mid-afternoon.   At that hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, ``Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?'' which is, being interpreted, ``My God, my God, why have
you forsaken me?''\footnote{Different gospels record different words spoken by Jesus, the only agreement being this lament, which is
given in both Mark and Matthew 27:46. Jesus quotes Psalms 22:1, in Aramaic. In all versions, his words on the cross are from scripture.

  Jesus cried out with a loud voice, and gave up the spirit.   The veil of the Temple was torn in two from the top to the bottom.

conflagration was the result of an order. Consequently, to get rid of
the report, Nero fastened the guilt and inflicted the most exquisite
tortures on a class hated for their abominations, called Chrestians by

things hideous and shameful from every part of the world find their

all who pleaded guilty; then, upon their information, an immense
multitude was convicted, not so much of the crime of firing the city,

Mockery of every sort was added to their deaths. Covered with the
skins of beasts, they were torn by dogs and perished, or were nailed
to crosses, or were doomed to the flames and burnt, to serve as a
nightly illumination, when daylight had expired. Nero offered his
gardens for the spectacle, and was exhibiting a show in the circus,
while he mingled with the people in the dress of a charioteer or stood
aloft on a car. Hence, even for criminals who deserved extreme and
exemplary punishment, there arose a feeling of compassion; for it was

\notetext{about-this-doc}{About this document; criteria for inclusion or exclusion}
I've added my own notes on points that I was originally unable to understand by reading the gospels,
including some information about the political, social, and historical context. I've attempted to
omit all material that, in my amateur opinion, seems to be a later overlay that would not have
been recognizable to Jesus or his contemporaries. An interesting and well known amateur project along
the same lines is the Thomas Jefferson Bible.

Unlike Jefferson, I include non-Christian sources and have
access to the Gospel of Thomas, and
I don't use scientific plausibility
as a criterion to exclude what otherwise may have been real, contemporary psychological experiences.
The healing miracles are there (although I omit some recaps of the same miracle), as are the appearances of the resurrected Jesus.
I don't believe that Jesus had a time machine, but I leave in
prophecies that are necessary in order to make sense of the story-line as told by Mark,
e.g., ``before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times.''

1. Red flags for the no-time-machine criterion are the following motifs:
\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*] % enumitem package
\item Christian symbolism or terminology used before they existed:
    (i) ``Take up your cross and follow me;''\footnote{\reftex{Matthew 16:24}, \reftex{Luke 9:23}}
    (ii) John the Baptist says, ``He who has the bride is the bridegroom;''\footnote{\reftex{John 3:29}}
    (iii) ``church;''\footnote{ἐκκλησίαν, literally ``assembly'' or ``gathering,'' \reftex{Matthew 16:18}}
    (iv) ``the Jews'' used as if Jesus and his followers were not Jews;\footnote{\reftex{John 7:1-8}}
    (v) symbolism of three days between the crucifixion and the resurrection;\footnote{\reftex{Mark 14:58}, \reftex{Luke 2:46}, \reftex{John 2:19-22}}
    (vi) ``the Temple'' used as a symbol for Jesus's body;\footnote{\reftex{John 2:21}}
    (vii) normal feasts used to prefigure the eucharist.\footnote{\reftex{John 7:8}}
\item Foreknowledge of the destruction of the Temple in 70 CE.\footnote{``I will destroy this
    Temple that is made with hands, and in three days I will build another made without 
    hands,'' \reftex{Mark 14:58}, with similar examples in \reftex{Mark 8:31}, \reftex{Mark 13:2}, \reftex{Mark 15:29}, \reftex{Luke 19:43},
    \reftex{John 2:19}, \reftex{Matthew 26:61},
    \reftex{Thomas 71}, and \reftex{Acts 6:14}
    The gospels and Acts were written down after the destruction of the Temple in 70 CE, so their authors are
    providing a retrodictive explanation of the significance of this event.}
\item Prophecy of betrayal and derision.\footnote{``How is it written about the Son of Man,
    that he should suffer many things and be despised?,'' \reftex{Mark 9:12}.
    It's possible that at some point Jesus realized he was embarking on a course of action that would result in his own destruction.
    But the Hebrew bible does not predict that the messiah will be betrayed, scorned, or despised. It paints him as a glorious and successful
    political, military, and religious leader. There was no time machine to allow the authors of the Hebrew bible to know that
    Jesus would be crucified. And the scriptural references don't even make much sense as prophecies. For example, \reftex{Psalms 22:1},
    ``My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?,'' makes sense as something Jesus would repeat on the cross, but Psalm 22 doesn't
    make sense as a prophecy about a messiah who will be scorned. It contains verses such as ``But I am a worm, and no man'' (\reftex{Psalms 22:6}),
    which clearly aren't meant to be about a messiah.}
\end{enumerate}

Also excluded:
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item Novel statements and commands by the resurrected Jesus (e.g., \reftex{Matthew 28:19}).
    Although some of these resurrection accounts may be real records of
    psychologically real experiences, naturalism requires that anything novel that Jesus says in them can only be the product of
    his followers' minds.
\item Garbling or incoherence attributable to the evangelist's agenda, often in the form of a botched elaboration at the end of
           a story (\notewithoutbackref{garbled-endings}).
\item Any discourse containing material that is clearly fabricated on the basis of the foregoing criteria (e.g., Matthew 16:24-28).
\end{enumerate}

I mostly follow Mark as the gospel that is the earliest and appears to contain the smallest
amount of later propaganda and theologizing. I make no attempt at completeness, and in some cases
I omit incidents from the non-Mark gospels or just give a brief summary. I've attempted to retain the
intelligible narrative thread of Mark, while freely rearranging some material in order to group
similar material together.
My criteria are arbitrary and personal, and they have the unfortunate side-effect of cutting out many
wonderful and culturally familiar sayings and events, such as ``Man shall not live by bread alone.''

The outcome of the approach that I follow is that there is not much
hint in the gospels of anything recognizable as Christianity. Jesus's
biography becomes that of the radicalized healthcare worker:-- Once
there were two healthcare workers, John the Baptist and his pupil
Jesus of Nazareth.  John is beheaded, and Jesus becomes
radicalized. Jesus comes to see the dysfunctional and exploitative
nature of the central healthcare administration as symptomatic of a
deeper rot in society. He predicts the coming of a mysterious kingdom
of God (and also, by some accounts, dispenses novel ethical teachings,
although not all witnesses recall this). In the end, he goes to the
central hospital, goes on a violent rampage, and commits suicide by
cop.

\notetext{john-provocative}{John's provocation}
\notesummary{John's actions and the symbolism of the Jordan are extremely politically provocative to the Roman-Judean regime.}
The Judean client regime and its centralized theocracy at the Temple in Jerusalem
has its own slaves and agricultural land, but its most lucrative source of revenue is
administering the complicated rituals prescribed in Leviticus,
which include both ablutions by the priests and blood sacrifices.
John carves out his own rogue franchise, competing with them by
offering free purification rituals.

John is not only challenging this monopoly but also (as Josephus carefully omits), by doing them in the
Jordan, evoking a politically supercharged echo of the return of the Jews to the promised land:

\bible{Numbers 27:12}{Yahweh said to Moses, ``Go up into this mountain of Abarim, and see the land which I have given to the children of Israel.''}

There follows in Numbers 27-29 an extremely lengthy list of commands about animal sacrifices to be made to God
once the people have been returned to the promised land. In Deuteronomy 34, God gives Moses another view of the
promised land, reiterating that it is for the offspring of Abraham --- i.e., in the ears of John's followers, not
to the Romans.
Moses's successor Joshua then miraculously crosses the Jordan (\reftex{Joshua 6}) and reconquers Canaan from the evil foreigners.

\notetext{john-ascetic}{John's asceticism}
A strain of asceticism was one of many currents of thought that were in the air among the many
contending schools of Judaism that included the Essene sect. It has been suggested that John was an Essene, but we don't know.

\notetext{john-social}{Authenticity of John's social teachings in Matthew}
The social teachings in Luke 3:10 seem unlikely to be authentic. John preached to
zealous Jews in the wilderness along the Jordan river. What were
tax collectors and soldiers doing there, among that group?
Tax collectors were shunned by the kind of people who would go to John,
and reaching out to include them was a remarkable feature of Jesus's mission, not John's.
There were separate Roman and Herodian militaries,\footnote{Chilton, p.~64}
but even if the soldiers were Jews (serving either Herod or, possibly, the Romans\footnote{Chilton, p.~165}),
it seems unlikely that they would have been free to go off on long hikes into the wilderness to meet up with
a radical who was symbolically attacking Herodian rule.
Unlike Jesus, John did not, as suggested by Luke,
gather people around him to live his teachings by sharing the necessities of daily life.

\notetext{family-interp}{Family background}
% Clean up, lots of commentary duplicated in main text.
% Also I duplicate Mark 6:2.
The Nazareans in Mark 6:2 are insulting Jesus by referring to him as Mary's son. As the eldest brother, he should be referred to as Joseph's son.
The implication is that he is illegitimate.\footnote{Aslan, p.~37}
The same communal perception is stated more explicitly in John 8:41, p.~\pageref{john-illegitimacy}.
Another straightforward description of Jesus's family is given
in Acts 1:14. 
The word τέκτονος, usually translated as ``carpenter,'' can also just mean a landless manual laborer\footnote{Crossan}
or be Roman slang for an ignorant peasant.\footnote{Aslan, p. 34} 

\notetext{james}{Jesus's brother James the Just}
After the crucifixion, Jesus's brother James took over his mission in Jerusalem.
He managed to coexist for a long time with the Temple while beginning to build
what would become the Christian church. He engaged in a bitter and long-running epistolary
and in-person conflict with Paul over the direction of the movement, and especially about the extent to
which the Mosaic law had to be followed. This resulted in the Council of Jerusalem in 50 CE (Acts 15).
James's life, and his biological relationship to Jesus, are well documented in a number of
historical sources, such as Josephus (Antiquities 20-9-1), Clement of Alexandria, and a long passage from Hegesippus quoted by Eusebius.
A claimed ossuary box, publicly announced in 2002, has been the subject of vigorous academic and legal disputes.

\notetext{jesus-galilee}{Galilee}
The Galileans had a reputation as
flinty hill people who didn't pay their taxes and were
anticlerical and resentful of Judea and the Temple.  Galilee produced
many bandits (Greek singular λῃστής), who in some cases may have had
political or Robin Hood overtones.

\notetext{nazareth}{Nazareth}\index{Nazareth!archaeology}\label{nazareth-archaeology}
Archaeological work demonstrates that the site of the town of Nazareth saw human occupation as early as
the iron age.\footnote{Y.~Alexandre, ``The settlement history of Nazareth in the Iron Age and early Roman period,'' 2020}
Work by Ken Dark suggests that, unlike nearby Sepphoris, Nazareth strongly resisted incursions by foreign religions
and cultures. The Nazareans left behind local styles of pottery and used limestone, which was considered
especially pure in Jewish culture. There are widely varying estimates of Nazareth's size during in Jesus's lifetime,
with some estimates being a population as low as a few hundred, while Dark's work suggests the existence of a fairly
large town.

\notetext{jesus-aramaic}{Jesus's language}
As child growing up in  Galilee, Jesus would have spoken a dialect of Aramaic,
with a distinctive accent.  (In Mark 14:70 at Gethsemane, p.~\pageref{peter-accent}, Peter is identified as a Galilean by his accent.)
The overwhelming majority of scholars believe that Jesus and his followers
spoke Aramaic to one another.\footnote{The linguist Birkeland wrote an influential article in 1954 arguing that
Jesus spoke Hebrew, but this is an extreme minority opinion that few experts support. He argues that when
Jesus is quoted as speaking Aramaic phrases in the gospels, it is because the rest of the time he is
speaking Hebrew. A more recent discussion is given by Barr.}
However, Hebrew was not yet a dead language in this time and place, and a Mishnaic Hebrew dialect is
found in contemporary literary works, contracts, letters, and some of the Dead Sea Scrolls.
Hebrew was probably no longer alive as a spoken language, but we don't know for sure.
Aramaic and Hebrew are similar languages, and some people at the time may have ``code switched'' among
Aramaic, Mishnaic Hebrew, and Biblical Hebrew as three different registers of speech,
as we do in English when we quote a phrase from Shakespeare. However, Josephus clearly distinguishes
``the Hebrew language'' from ``the language of our country.''\index{Josephus!Hebrew distinguished from Aramaic}

\notetext{literacy}{Jesus' education and ability to read}
\notesummary{We have no reliable evidence about whether Jesus was literate. If not, then his
exposure to the Hebrew bible would have been through oral targums, singing psalms, and possibly John the Baptist.
He may or may not have had a detailed familiarity with the Hebrew bible.}

Many experts believe that Jesus was unable to read.  Any opportunities
to learn to read or write would have been extremely scarce, hence the
disbelief expressed in Mark 6:2. Reading was an activity for the
privileged leisure class. Jesus spent his days chopping down trees and
planing boards. On the other hand, Jesus was one of the most
exceptional people in history, and he may have risen above these
circumstances and learned to read, like Frederick Douglass.
The gospels say that Jesus did not have any formal opportunity to learn to read, and if this is true, then he must have
taught himself or learned informally from someone:

\john{7:15}{
The Jews therefore marveled, saying, ``How does this man know letters, having never been educated?''\footnote{John has Jesus
respond essentially that his knowledge comes divine inspiration.}
}

There were probably no institutions similar to our modern schools. Children worked. We don't have any clear picture of how
literacy was transmitted in this culture. There must have been provisions
in Jerusalem to train the scribal class, but no such thing would have existed in a tiny,
backwoods town like Nazareth. What might have existed there was a synagogue.\footnote{Aslan, p.~35, claims that no such synagogue existed. The
synagogue at Capernaum, which the gospels record Jesus as visiting as an adult, was 40 km away. Sepphoris was much closer,
and tradition has it that it is Mary's home town. It has been speculated that Jesus worked there. However, there is evidence, including
archaeological evidence, that Nazareth was an insular town and that its people saw the Hellenized Sepphoris as alien and unholy.
Luke 4:16 places Jesus in a synagogue in
Nazareth, but we don't know if one actually existed there. Any such scene, if historical,
could have occurred just as easily in some larger town. Luke, if he existed as an individual,
probably never came within 300 miles of Nazareth.}
We have at least some knowledge of what such a place would have been like, if Nazareth had 
one.\footnote{Levine, ``The Nature and Origin of the Palestinian Synagogue Reconsidered,'' \url{https://sci-hub.do/10.2307/3266895}}
In earlier centuries, as described in the Hebrew bible, there had been shrines and outdoor ceremonies
at the city gates. Over time, these were moved indoors, to synagogues. Before the destruction of
the second temple in Jerusalem, the functions of the synagogue
did not overlap with the sacrifices and purification rituals of the Jerusalem Temple. Instead, it
functioned like a modern hotel and community center which on the sabbath was a house of worship and
possibly a library.

The main religious activity in a synagogue was the hearing of scripture. (There were prayers, but
probably no standardized liturgy.) A synagogue in a small town probably would not have possessed
a copy of the torah or other Hebrew scriptures, which would have been a bulky and extremely expensive object that was
also not very user-friendly. (The text was written without any vowels, spaces between words, or marks
to show where a section began or ended.) Later synagogues had shrines for the torah, but the archaeological
evidence doesn't seem to show that these existed during Jesus's lifetime.
A rabbi in Galilee would have spoken the scriptures aloud in Hebrew, either from memory or by reading.
He would then follow up with a translation and commentary in Aramaic, called a targum. It
was forbidden for these targums to be written down until after the destruction of the Temple in 70 CE.

From a straight reading of the gospels, we would get the impression that
the adult Jesus had a deep knowledge of the scripture and was able to
debate its fine points skillfully. But actually the passages in the gospels where he quotes scripture
often show signs of being later layers added by Christian writers (\notewithoutbackref{quoting-scripture}).
In authentic passages, his style is to teach in parables, cite secular proverbs, and make up his own
short, pithy sayings. 

It's possible that Jesus simply had a sketchy knowledge of scripture, patched together from hearing targums
and the singing of psalms. His final
words according to Mark 15:34 and Matthew 27:46 are a quotation from
Psalms, in Aramaic, which suggests that these two evangelists thought
that his knowledge of the scriptures was in Aramaic (presumably from hearing that psalm sung). If this was not
the case, then it's hard to imagine why these two evangelists would have
taken the trouble to write down the quote, transliterated into the Greek
alphabet, and then painstakingly translate into Greek for their Greek-speaking audience.

Luke 4:16 clearly portrays Jesus as literate, but
this is likely an inauthentic later overlay. 

Mark 2:25 is usually translated so that Jesus says, ``Did you never read...,'' but in fact the
phrase οὐδέποτε ἀνέγνωτε can be translated in a variety of ways, such as ``Did you never know well...''
This raises the issue of the wide variety of meanings that is possible for the Greek verb ἀναγιγνώσκω.

Literally, this verb means to ``re-recognize'' or ``know very well,''
with ανα- indicating either repetition or intensification. Homer uses
it in this sense (α.216): ``οὐ γάρ πώ τις ἑὸν γόνον αὐτὸς ἀνέγνω,''
``For no man knows his own birth.'' Later, literacy adds additional
meanings to this word.  When used as a transitive verb, with the
object being a written text, it can also mean to read, the semantic
link being that when we read, we repeat and know more intensely our
verbal knoledge.  Pagan authors use it to describe actions like
attending a lecture, publishing a book, or reciting or reading a text
aloud to an audience.  (Although today we take it as a sign of low
literacy when someone mouths the words while reading, in the ancient
world it was probably more common even for the most educated readers
to do so.)

The verb ἀναγιγνώσκω is used many times in the NT, with meanings that
cannot all be the same.  (1) Private or silent reading: in John 19:20,
spectators at the crucifixion read the sign that says "JESUS OF
NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS," which probably means that they read
silently to themselves -- they were not reciting the words for others.
(2) Reading a text out loud to a group: in Acts 15:31, a newly
delivered letter is read out loud to a group of early Christians.  (3)
If Acts 13:27, Acts 15:21, and Luke 4:16 describe actual historical
events, then they are describing a complicated process of telling the
scriptures on the sabbath to a group of people at a synagogue. The
audiences would have been predominantly or entirely composed of
Aramaic speakers, but during Jesus's lifetime, it was forbidden to
write down Aramaic targums. Therefore the ἀναγιγνώσκω would have to
mean something more complex.  In Luke 4:16, Jesus is teaching at the
synagogue in Nazareth from Isaiah, to a crowd of illiterate Aramaic
speakers, and he refers to a scroll, which has to be in Hebrew. Jesus
may be paraphrasing in Aramaic on the fly, and referring to the text
to remind himself of what it says. Or possibly he reads the Hebrew out
loud, which almost nobody in the room can understand, and then follows
up with an Aramaic translation.  Of course it's also possible that
Luke simply invented the scene and was unaware of the language issue.

In Mark 2:23, p.~\pageref{foraging-on-sabbath}, as well as in the similar versions
given in Matthew 12:3 and Luke 6:3, Jesus reproves the Pharisees about their lack
of scriptural knowledge, saying, ``Οὐδέποτε ἀνέγνωτε (Did you never read/know) what David did\ldots''
If the verb is translated as ``read,'' then it would seem to imply that Jesus can read, since he
considers himself superior to the Pharisees. Given the wide range of possible meanings for the verb,
``know'' seems equally possible.

\notetext{in-you-i-am-well-pleased}{In you I am well pleased}
The gospels describe Jesus's baptism by John in ways that seem like attempts to rewrite history and make Jesus rather than John the master,
which would be contrary to the historical evidence that John was the much more important and well known figure during the two mens' lifetimes.
Jesus's baptism is also attended by a supernatural appearance by God, which doesn't meet my criteria for inclusion because it
is a retrodiction of later Christian teachings to a time when those teachings didn't exist. The earliest manuscript of Luke, frequently
quoted by the church fathers, has this:

\luke{3:21}{
Now when all the people were baptized, Jesus also had been baptized and was praying. The sky was opened,   and the holy spirit descended in a bodily form like a dove on him; and a voice came out of the sky, saying ``You are my son, today I have begotten you.''
}

This is a quote of \reftex{Psalms 2:7}.
The theology is altered in later manuscripts, which change God's words to ``You are my beloved son. In you I am well pleased.''

\notetext{jtb-sequence}{Sequence of events related to John the Baptist}
Mark has the baptism in 1:9, a theologizing visitation by God in 1:10-11,
a solitary vision quest in 1:12-13, and John's arrest in 1:14, and the evangelist uses the word ``immediately''
twice to say that the first three of these things happened in rapid-fire order, and therefore before John's arrest.
In addition to violating the no-time-machine criterion (\notewithoutbackref{in-you-i-am-well-pleased}), the divine visitation doesn't make
narrative sense. If Jesus has had a personal visit from God, and knows that God is his father and is on his side,
then there is no need for him to go out into the wilderness to try to sort things out. Mark wants to insist that
all of these events happen, implausibly, in some very short period of time, because he doesn't want to admit that
Jesus could have gone to John because he wanted to learn things from him.

The plausible sequence of events is that Jesus is baptized by John, he spends time learning from him,
John is arrested, and then Jesus, now a free agent with no one to guide him, goes on a vision quest to decide what to do.

\notetext{false-prophecy-executation}{The crime of false prophecy; methods of execution}
In Luke 4, Jesus speaks in the synagogue at Nazareth, blames his failure to heal
there on the Nazareans' lack of faith, identifies himself as a prophet, and is almost killed by
an angry mob. The story doesn't occur in the other gospels, but John 8 conflates it with a scene at the Temple
in Jerusalem. In 4:29, ``They rose up, threw him out of the city, and led him to
the brow of the hill that their city was built on, that they might throw him off the cliff.''
There is actually no hill in Nazareth that could have served this purpose.
Luke describes what he thinks is prescribed by tradition, and later the talmud, as a
ritualized form of capital punishment (Sanhedrin 6-IV) for specific crimes. 
If the criminal wasn't killed by the fall, he would be stoned to death. This was the method of execution that actually was
used against Jesus's brother James.
Luke likes to supply legalistic details that he has no way of knowing about.
The actual incident would have been more like backwoods vigilante justice, but
since Jesus has just pronounced himself as a prophet, it seems clear to me that he is to be executed for
being a false prophet. (But various interpretations have been proposed, Hill 1971.)
The torah defines the crime, the punishment, and the criteria for deciding, sensibly enough,
whether the prophet is false:

\bible{Deuteronomy 18:20}{
But the prophet who speaks a word presumptuously in my name, which I have not commanded him to speak, or who speaks in the name of other gods, that same prophet shall die.
You may say in your heart, ``How shall we know the word which Yahweh has not spoken?''   When a prophet speaks in Yahweh's name, if the thing doesn't follow, nor happen, that is the thing which Yahweh has not spoken. The prophet has spoken it presumptuously. You shall not be afraid of him.
}

Jesus is guilty under this legal test, because he failed to heal.

\notetext{fugitive}{Historicity of Jesus as a fugitive}
Luke and John portray Jesus as living on the run from the law, constantly in danger
of arrest, sneaking around, and alienated from his family. This is probably an ahistorical exaggeration. Mark doesn't
describe many of these events, although he does recount a temporary alienation from his family
(\reftex{Mark 3:31}, p.~\pageref{who-are-my-mother-and-my-brothers}), makes it clear enough that John the Baptist and Jesus were both executed, and 
depicts Jesus as keeping a messianic secret.

The material in Luke and John may be an attempt to
puff up the dramatic conflict, and to avoid their listeners' default tendency to see a character like Jesus as
just one more Galilean bandit, who was not very smart and therefore got himself killed.
A bandit only qualifies as a folk hero if he is constantly slipping through the fingers of the law.
A more extreme example of lurid crime fiction in the gospels is the sensationalized details of
John the Baptist's execution. A less extreme example is \reftex{John 2:15}, in which Jesus's assault on
the moneychangers in the Temple is made more violent by saying that he used a whip.

In John's case there is also an
overt anti-semitic agenda of deflecting blame for the crucifixion from the Romans to ``the Jews,''
whom he depicts as unreasonably hostile. \reftex{John 7-8} is probably Christian fiction,
and \reftex{John 7:1-8}\footnote{in which Jesus stays safe in Galilee, but his brothers taunt him to go
and perform miracles in Jerusalem during Sukkoth} doesn't meet my criteria for inclusion.\footnote{It has an
ahistorical description of ``the Jews'' and anachronistic Christian symbolism of the eucharist. \notewithoutbackref{about-this-doc}}

A more mundane and inherently plausible picture is one in which Jesus stays safe by staying
almost entirely in Galilee, his familiar home turf, where there may be a threat from Herod Antipas but
not from the Temple priesthood or the Romans. He doesn't even rise to the attention of the Jersualem authorities until he
intentionally commits  provocative acts at the Temple. Then, according to Mark 12:12, he does temporarily
slip through the law's fingers, although he is arrested and executed very soon afterward.

\notetext{bethsaida}{Bethsaida}
Several locations have been proposed for the town of Bethsaida, some on the Sea of Galilee and some not.
The biblical references may be to more than one of these places.
The bible describes three of the messengers as coming from Bethsaida. In Mark 6:45, Jesus sends
the students to Bethsaida while he goes away by himself to pray on a mountain.

\notetext{jesus-writing}{Scribes; Jesus' ability to write}
If Jesus could write, it was
probably at the level of ``craftsman's literacy,'' such as the ability
to record business records. John, in the course of the story of the woman
taken in adultery, says,

\john{8:6} But Jesus stooped down and wrote on the ground with his finger.

The verb translated here as ``wrote'' is κατέγραφεν, which could mean either that he wrote or that he drew.

Writing at the highest level of literacy
was more like a specialized profession, that of a scribe. Because
scribes were often officials in the hated Roman regime, analogous to lawyers and bureaucrats, most
references to them in the NT are negative.\footnote{an exception being Mark 12:28, p.~\pageref{greatest-commandments}} A scribe can also indicate one
who is literate and religiously learned, and this class of people was also
suspect because they were part of a leisure class associated with the exploitative practices of the Temple.

Jesus would have had no reason to write down any of his teachings, either himself or with the
help of a scribe. His followers were illiterate, and the Kingdom of God was coming, so there was
no need to record anything for future generations.

\notetext{chronology}{Summary of time and place in the gospels}
Jesus was itinerant, and the synoptic gospels present his story as a road trip, whose broad outline is plausible:
the country boy Jesus is chased out of his tiny home village of Nazareth, then travels to the large town of Capernaum,\footnote{The gospels
disagree on the details. Luke has Jesus first in Capernaum (implied at 4:23), then Nazareth (4:16), then Capernaum again (4:31).}
gathers followers, and finally takes his gaggle of hippies to the capital of Judea,
the Jewish center of the universe. Most or all of the twelve messengers were
probably Galileans,\footnote{\reftex{Acts 1:11}. If Judas's name Iscariot derives from
the town of Kerioth, then he was a Judean.}
which makes sense if Jesus spent all but the final part of his mission in Galilee.

To get to Capernaum in \reftex{Mark 1:21}, Jesus would have probably passed through\footnote{map, Funk, p.~xxii} the rich Hellenistic cities of
Sepphoris (sacked in 4 BCE after a revolt) and Tiberias (built in 20 CE). Perhaps the poor and less cosmopolitan
population of Capernaum was more likely to be a receptive audience.

% https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronology_of_Jesus

Despite their narrative form,
the synoptic gospels actually often arrange the incidents not like a chronology but according to the topics that the evangelists want to illustrate.
Therefore it's a vain exercise to try to create a calendar of the events they portray. The synoptic evangelists were working
from an oral tradition of Jesus's famous deeds, and of his sayings and parables, most of which were presumably things he said over and over
again to different audiences. These authors wrote a screenplay of a road trip, with a sophisticated literary framework,
and fit in the well known words and deeds where needed in order to illustrate the unfamiliar concepts of their new
religion.

Even more so than the synoptics, John is concerned with
theology over history, or even narrative. The sequence of events in
John is wildly different from what the synoptics give (with the
assault on the Temple, John 2:13, occurring \emph{before} the rest of
the ministry).

We would at least like to know how long Jesus's mission
lasted. If we take the gospels as factual on such matters, then it was probably one to three years.  Luke 3:1 dates the beginning of
John the Baptist's mission to 28 or 29 CE.  The gospels also say that
the last supper was a Passover seder, and that Jesus died before
sunset on a Friday. The depiction of a last supper is clearly at least partly fabricated, but it does make sense
that Jesus's arrest would have occurred when he was in Jerusalem on a required pilgrimage such as the one for Passover, and
there is no obvious reason for the evangelists to fabricate the fact that his death was on a Friday.  Based on calendrical
arguments, this makes the best candidates for the date of
the crucifixion 30 and 33 CE.\footnote{Humphreys and Waddington,
``Dating the crucifixion,'' Nature, 1983. doi:10.1038/306743a0. They also list 27 and 34 as possible years, but 27 would be earlier
than Luke's date for the beginning of John the Baptist's mission, and 34 requires unlikely hypotheses about weather and the
observation of the moon. Josephus states that Pilate was removed in 36/37.}

However, all of this depends on the assumed reliability of the
gospels as to chronology, whereas we know them to be very \emph{inaccurate} as journalism.
Arguments for very different results can be made.
John 8:57 has Jesus being challenged by people saying, ``You are not yet fifty years old! Have you seen Abraham?''
Irenaeus argues that Jesus's apparent biological age could not have been anything like 30, because then these
hostile skeptics would have strengthened their point by saying, ``Your are not yet forty 
years old!''\footnote{White, Jesus at Fifty: Irenaeus on John 8:57 and the Age of Jesus.
The Journal of Theological Studies, 71(1), 158–163. doi:10.1093/jts/flz170}
But this cannot be reconciled simultaneously with Luke 3:1 and with Josephus's date for Pilate's removal.

Attempts to further clarify the chronology and duration of Jesus's mission get even shakier.
These have tended to revolve around counting Jesus's visits to the Temple in Jerusalem at festivals.
The different gospels describe different numbers of these 
visits,\footnote{John 6:4 is suspect \note{john-loaves-and-fishes}.} and in Mark 11, for example, all the coming and going to the Temple with impunity may seem hard to believe, especially
if the authorities were now so intent on killing Jesus. Actually 
Jesus would have been theoretically obligated (\reftex{Deuteronomy 16:16}) to make pilgrimages to
Jerusalem every year for three different festivals, one of which was Passover.
So in fact the
number of Temple visits mentioned in the gospels can be argued to be too small, even if
Jesus's public mission was a year or less in length.\footnote{Vermes, p.~371} But
there is no reason to expect that the gospels would have recorded every such
voyage by Jesus, and practical necessities would in any case have prevented every Galilean
town from sending away all its men three times a year for a long pilgrimage (about
a ten-day round trip on foot from Nazareth).\footnote{Chilton, p.~23}
\reftex{John 7:1-8} gives an example where Jesus skips one such pilgrimage for fear of arrest, although
that passage doesn't meet my criteria for inclusion because of its ahistorical description of ``the Jews''
and anachronistic Christian symbolism of the eucharist \notewithoutbackref{about-this-doc}.

\notetext{peter}{Biographical sketch of Peter}\index{Peter!biographical sketch}
Peter is traditionally considered the founder of the Catholic Church and its first pope.
He is a married man (Mark 1:30; 1 Corinthians 9:5). As an Aramaic-speaking
fisherman from the Galilean town of Bethsaida (\reftex{John 1:44}), he
was illiterate\footnote{``ἀγράμματος,'' \reftex{Acts 4:13}} and so left no writings.\footnote{The epistles of Peter were written
by someone else.}
Although his brother Andrew's name is Greek (``Manly''),
they were both Jews (Galatians 2:14). They were followers of John the Baptist (John 1:40).
Peter's original name was Simon. Before meeting Jesus he may have already been nicknamed in Aramaic as Cephas, ``Rock,'' 
which suggests a rough character. He is a hothead (\reftex{Mark 8:31}), sometimes violent
(\reftex{John 18:10}), thick in the head (like all the messengers in Mark), and a
coward who will lie to save his own skin (\reftex{Mark 14:72}).

In an anachronistic passage meant to convey authority after Jesus's death,
\reftex{Matthew 16:16}, Peter volunteers out of nowhere that Jesus is ``the Christ, the Son of the living God.''
This is a recurring type of formula inserted in the gospels
by the later Christian church as a model for its members to confess their faith.\footnote{Funk, p.~207}
A pleased Jesus plays on the Aramaic nickname and calls him Peter, saying ``and on this rock I will build
my church.'' The Greek word for church, ἐκκλησίαν (``gathering''), occurs in the gospels only in Matthew, and labels an
institution that was only later conceived and built, during the apostolic age. Given the head-butting between Peter and
Paul (\reftex{Galatians 2:11}), it is significant that Paul almost always refers to Peter as Cephas, rather than the authority-giving
name Peter.\footnote{Vermes, p.~361}

Peter made his way to Rome and became the leader of what was eventually the Catholic Church.
He was martyred by Nero.

\notetext{leper-anger}{Emotional terms in Greek and English; Jesus's initial reaction to the leper}
\reftex{Mark 1:41} describes Jesus's emotional reaction to being accosted by a leper.
Some sources have ὀργισθεὶς, others σπλαγχνισθεὶς.
These terms may not translate easily, because there is not necessarily a one-to-one correspondence between Greek and English emotional categories.
Where English uses adjectives to describe an internal emotional state, ``John is happy,'' Greek uses verbs
that deal with an outward cause or sign, ``John rejoices,'' or ``John is fortunate.''

Οργίζω usually means to anger, but can mean to arouse passions. It may be related to ὄργια, a term used most often to refer
to the cathartic and liberating secret rites of the cult of Dionysus.

Σπλαγχνίζω  derives from the ritual practice of eating the internal organs of a sacrifice. Metaphorically, these innards are the seat of
emotion. The ritual was practiced not just by pagans but also by Jews (\reftex{Leviticus 1:13}).
Cf.~modern English ``I was gutted,'' ``eat your heart out.'' Usually in the gospels σπλαγχνίζω more clearly refers to compassion,
but here it need not, and could be taken as saying that Jesus was ``gut-wrenched,'' a natural reaction to being
confronted by someone with a loathsome disease. The evangelists would have known both the ``gut'' connotation and the ritualistic
one, which 
Either word seems perfectly believable given the cultural context (\notewithoutbackref{leper-seditious}).

There is textual evidence for preferring ὀργισθεὶς.
It would be more natural for a scribe to emend ὀργισθεὶς to σπλαγχνισθεὶς, rather than the
other way around, in order to harmonize with
the description of Jesus's emotions elsewhere in the gospels.
Matthew and Luke simply omit the description of Jesus's emotional state in their versions of
this story, which are presumably based on Mark's. Luke has a general agenda of
portraying Jesus as imperturbable, but he does describe Jesus as compassionate
elsewhere, so it's hard to see why he would delete σπλαγχνισθεὶς here, while it's
obvious why he would delete the more negative ὀργισθεὶς.

\notetext{leper-seditious}{Healing the leper as a seditious act}
The leper in \reftex{Mark 1:40} is ritually unclean, and the Temple has a prescribed
and expensive ritual for cleansing him, which is laid out in detail in \reftex{Leviticus 13:2}. Jesus's command to go to the Temple 
for a follow-up visit (1:44) is natural because, although he disdains the people running the place and rejects their authority,
he reveres the Temple itself, and it has the high-tech medical equipment.
His initial anger in Mark 1:41 (if this is the original text, rather than
``compassion'') makes sense in terms of this context, because the leper is asking him
to do something illicit and contrary to the Mosaic law. The Egerton papyrus's added ``μηκέτι ἁμάρτανε'' literally means
both ``sin no more'' and ``stop making mistakes.'' In the tanakh, leprosy is a punishment from god, but the Egerton papyrus's
account seems to show this being revised during this period of history to something more like our modern understanding of
infectious disease, although the reconstruction of the text about traveling and eating with lepers is uncertain.

The reason for the secrecy in Mark 1:35 is clarified once we see it again in 1:43-44, addressed this time to the leper.
Following John's execution, Jesus is a former member of
what the Romans would consider an outlaw group of seditionists or λῃσται (bandits).  Futhermore, both John and Jesus have challenged the
centralized theocracy's monopoly on purification ceremonies. As a subversive, Jesus is nearly killed by a mob
in Nazareth. Mark may also be weaving these facts into a
literary prefiguring of his motif of the messianic secret.

In addition to the objective historical reasons why it might have made sense for Jesus's movement to have worked in secret,
there is textual evidence that the secrecy in Mark was an early tradition, and therefore possibly closer to the historical truth.
In \reftex{Mark 1:44}, Jesus tells the leper to keep the healing secret. 
Matthew inserts this story into his own narrative as Jesus and his followers are hiking back down from the sermon on the mount,
and says that there were ``great multitudes'' present (8:1), but then has Jesus give the command of secrecy (8:4) as in Mark, which doesn't make
sense. Mark Goodacre argues that this is an example of editorial fatigue by Matthew, who habitually introduced large crowds
in his accounts.

\notetext{son-of-man}{``Son of man''}
A good summary of this controversial topic is given in a review article by Burkett.\footnote{
Burkett, ``The Nontitular Son of Man: A History and Critique,'' 1994, New Testament Studies, 40(04), 504–521. doi:10.1017/s0028688500026448 
}
Working backwards from the Greek text, the most likely possibility is that ``barnasha'' was the Aramaic phrase that 
Jesus spoke to mean ``son of man.''\footnote{If Jesus had wanted to clarify, he could have said something like ``hahu barnasha,'' ``this-here son of man,''
clarifying that he was referring indirectly to himself. But this would have been translated into Greek
as something more like ``ουτος ο υιος του ανθρώπου.'' 
``Bar gabra'' or the absolute ``bar enash'' are also possible. Burkett, pp.~515-516}
It's a poetic Hebrew and Aramaic idiom for a human being. In these languages, it's the same as ``son of Adam,'' since
the name Adam just means ``man.'' There is no difference in these languages between ``a son of man'' 
and ``the son of man.''\footnote{Nouns exist in three states, absolute, emphatic, and construct. By Jesus's time, the distinction
between absolute and emphatic was disappearing for nouns in Aramaic, so there were two states. The construct state is used for
meanings like ``goal of existence,'' with the modified word ``goal'' changing form to the construct state and the two words
being mashed together into one unit, ``glexistence.'' The emphatic state is used where we would use a definite article
in English. Since a noun can't be in both the emphatic state and the construct state, there is no difference between
``a goal of existence'' and ``the goal of existence.'' ``Son,'' ``bara,'' becomes ``bar'' in the construct.}
Either one is a grammatically possible construal of Aramaic
``barnasha.'' When the evangelists wrote down their translations of Jesus's Aramaic words into Greek,
which does have a distinction between the two, they therefore had a choice, and they generally translated it 
using a definite article, such as ``ο'' in Mark 2:10, ``ο υιος του ανθρώπου.''


The Hebrew bible shows us the variety of usages and connotations associated with this phrase.
For example, God uses it over and over as a form of address to Ezekiel, something like ``O mortal man.''
There it emphasizes man's weakness and inferiority to God, but it can also be used to talk about man's authority
over the rest of the physical world:

\bible{Psalms 8:4}{
What is man, that you are mindful of him, or the son of man, that you care for him?
For you have made him a little lower than the angels,
and crowned him with glory and honor.
You gave him dominion over the works of your hands and put all things under his feet.
}

``Son of man'' occurs 95 times in Ezekiel, 20 times elsewhere in the Hebrew bible, 83 times
on the lips of Jesus, and once as spoken by Stephen in Acts 7:56. Jesus never uses any other words that could be construed as a self-title.
Notably, it never occurs in Paul, the earliest
written record of Jesus or of Christianity, which suggests that it may have been added to the gospels relatively late.


Let's focus on Mark  as the earliest and least fictionalized gospel.
Mark has 13 occurrences of the phrase ``son of man,'' which I render below as ***.

\begin{tabular}{lp{70mm}}
ambiguous & 2:10, [To scribes:] ``But that you may know that *** has authority on earth to forgive sins''--he said to the paralytic-- '' \\
          & 2:28, [To pharisees:] ``Therefore *** is lord even of the sabbath.'' \\
fabricated & 8:31, 8:38, 9:9, 9:12, 9:31, 10:33, 10:45, 13:26, 14:21, 14:41 \\
ahistorical & 14:62, [Asked by the high priest whether he is the messiah:]
                 ``Jesus said, `I am. You will see *** sitting at the right hand of power, and coming with the clouds of the sky.'{}''
\end{tabular}

It's striking how many of these are either fabrications\footnote{13:26 is more ambiguous than the others, but the scene is set
``on the Mount of Olives opposite the Temple,'' which Jesus prophecies will be destroyed. The long discourse reads as a Christian
fabrication.} by my criteria \notewithoutbackref{about-this-doc}
or ahistorical (the historically impossible trial before the sanhedrin, 14:62).
The remaining authentic instances, both in Mark 2, might or might not constitute an oral memory
of some characteristic saying of Jesus, like Star Trek's Captain Picard saying ``Make it so,''
and none of my argument depends much on whether it is or not.

Both the examples in Mark 2 occur in the context of rabbinical debates between
Jesus and the theocracy's leisure/literate class, and in both cases the subject of debate is whether it's all
right to violate the rules and prerogatives ordained by God and enforced by the theocracy.
The theocrats tell Jesus, ``You can't do that.''
In both cases, there is then a very natural way of understanding Jesus's comeback: ``Anyone can do that.''\footnote{Aramaicists consider
``anyone'' to be a possible reading. See Burkett, p.~510.}
That is, ``anyone has authority to forgive sins,'' and ``man is lord even of the sabbath.'' This would have been a natural
and familiar use of the phrase, as in Psalms 8:4.

These readings make much more sense than the titular one given in most
English translations, ``the Son of Man.'' That would be a mysterious distinction without a
difference, like ``the Man With Two Legs.'' How does such a non-distinction
grant ``authority on earth'' or make someone ``lord?''

We don't know whether Jesus chose this as a signature phrase, but there is an obvious reason why it would resonate for him as an individual.
He is considered by his community to be a mamzer, a person born of forbidden sex, and they
like to rub his nose in it (Mark 6:2). By using this phrase in confrontational situations, Jesus
is taking his status and throwing it back at his opponents, like a person in US culture who
embraces a label like ``slut'' or the n-word. It's not just that ``any random guy has the authority,''
but ``any random bastard like me has the authority.''

The main objection raised against the generic interpretation of ``son of man'' is that it doesn't
work for usages like the ones in Mark 8-10 and 14.\footnote{Burkett, p.~520} This objection seems
irrelevant to me, since these passages are clearly Christian fabrications.

In standard Christian theology, the phrase ``son of man'' is said to be a reference to
one place in the apocalyptic book of Daniel (7:13-14), which dates to a period of Seleucid persecution,
where the the phrase is used to discuss a prehistoric world-wide kingdom and
subsequent ``everlasting dominion,'' ongoing and already established by ``one like a son of man'' who
``came with the clouds of the sky.''\footnote{This portion of Daniel was originally written in Hebrew.}
The trouble is that there is no evidence that the messianic interpretation of this verse existed
Jesus's lifetime. Such an interpretation occurs in the non-canonical Book of Enoch, but the relevant
parts of Enoch were not among the fragments found at Qumran. Since there is no evidence that such
a meaning would have been intended or understood by anyone during Jesus's lifetime, there is not
much motivation for considering it if one is working from naturalistic and historical criteria.
However, it's possible that it was a code word used by Jesus's dissident group so that they could
talk about his secret claims of being the messiah, but have plausible deniability. It would then
be a double entendre known to the in-group.

\notetext{matthew-second-discourse}{The second discourse of Matthew}
The commissioning of the messengers in Mark 3 is very brief, but
Matthew has Jesus delivering a long Polonius-style speech to the students after this.
There are commands meant to Judaize the movement (Matthew's audience was the Jews), and prophecies about the persecution
of the Christians. Interspersed with these are many
memorable sayings, including reassurances to his apparently very frightened messengers.
I have included mainly the portions that the Jesus Seminar judges most likely to be authentic.

\notetext{not-peace-but-a-sword}{Not peace but a sword}
During the second discourse of Matthew, Jesus says, ``Don't think that
I came to send peace on the earth. I didn't come to send peace, but a
sword.  For I came to set a man at odds against his father, and a
daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her
mother-in-law.  A man's foes will be those of his own household.''
Starting at ``For I came\ldots,'' Jesus is paraphrasing Micah
7:5. The context is that Jesus has just been telling prophecies about
the later persecution of the early Christians.
These famous verses are judged inauthentic by the Jesus
Seminar. 

\notetext{quoting-scripture}{Jesus quoting scripture}
In Mark, Jesus seldom quotes from scripture. Nothing of this kind occurs until Mark 7:7.
In Matthew he frequently does, and sometimes when Mark and Matthew relate the same speech, Matthew
has scriptural references on Jesus's lips that are not there in Mark (e.g., \reftex{Mark 2:17} versus \reftex{Matthew 9:13}).
Sometimes in these rabbinical debates, one evangelist inserts obscure legalistic details that another evangelist omits.

The Jesus Seminar tends to call scriptural references by Jesus inauthentic and hypothesizes that Jesus didn't actually
talk that way. I'm using naturalistic criteria rather than textual
ones, but often they lead to the same conclusion, since the scriptural support is often used to argue
that Christian doctrines are the fulfillment of scriptural prophecies, and this is not naturalistically possible
because Jesus didn't have a time machine and couldn't have known what the doctrines of this future religion would be.

It's possible that Jesus simply had a sketchy knowledge of scripture, patched together from hearing targums
and the singing of psalms.



\notetext{jesus-mission-to-jews}{Whether Jesus's mission extended to the gentiles}
By the standards of a modern multicultural society, Jesus is a nasty bigot, referring to other
ethnic groups as pigs and dogs (Matthew 7:6, Mark 7:27). The archaeological evidence (p.~\pageref{nazareth-archaeology})
supports the idea that Nazareth was a stubborn holdout against the invading Hellenistic culture represented by nearby Sepphoris.
If he is the messiah, then the expectation based on the models from the Hebrew bible is that he will be a military and
political leader, and will reenact Joshua's deeds by expelling
the invaders from the promised land. The precedent from Joshua is genocidal:\footnote{Of the whole population of Jericho, Joshua spares only the prostitute Rahab.}

\bible{Joshua 6:21}{
They utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and woman, both young and old, and ox, sheep, and donkey, with the edge of the sword.
}

Compared to these expectations, Jesus is less threatening. He grudgingly heals gentiles rather than hurting them.
He talks about turning the other cheek, and potentially considering gentiles as ``neighbors'' (Luke 10:29, p.~\pageref{good-samaritan}),
whom we should love.
Had his implicit political promises somehow succeeded, we have reason to expect that he would not have carried
out a genocide. 

But Jesus never speaks to any gentile about the kingdom of God, and he repeatedly tells his followers
not to spread their message to the gentiles, especially in Matthew (7:6, 10:5). Although
Matthew does conclude with the resurrected Jesus telling the eleven messengers to ``make students of all nations'' (\reftex{Matthew 28:19}),
these commands are not authentic teachings of Jesus by my criteria (\notewithoutbackref{about-this-doc}), and
the fact that they contradict the rest of Matthew also marks them as fabrications by some later editor.\footnote{Cf.~the aftermath of
the exorcism of the Gadarene demoniac, p.~\pageref{gadarene-aftermath}.}

The differences between the synoptic gospels clearly have something to do with power struggles over the
direction of the early church. All three are constrained by Jesus's well-known sayings and by the fact,
clearly remembered by his followers, that he gathered a band of messengers who were all members of the same
Galilean ethnic sub-group. If Luke was a historical individual, he may have been a gentile, and the Lukan author(s)
clearly want to expand the mission, after Jesus's death, to include
the gentiles (e.g., \reftex{Luke 4:27}, about Naaman the Syrian). The authors of Matthew, on the other hand,
are clearly writing for a Jewish audience, hence the fabricated genealogy and birth at Bethlehem. The question
is then whether one version or the other of Jesus's teachings is more authentic. That is, did Matthew
manufacture the words in 10:5 and 15:24, forbidding teaching the gentiles, or did Mark and Luke erase them? The latter seems more likely,
by the criterion of embarassment, and is also consistent with what we see in Matthew 28:19:
later editors made additions and deletions in Jesus's words in order to make the gospels
sound welcoming to gentiles. See Vermes, p.~376.

\notetext{sermon-on-the-mount}{The sermon on the mount}
The sermon on the mount in Matthew 5-7 summarizes nearly everything that Jesus has to say about ethics.
(There is also a shorter sermon on the plain, Luke 6:20-49.) It reads as a greatest-hits compilation of his most pithy and
memorable wisdom sayings. There is a hypothesis that these sayings in Matthew and Luke come from a common source called Q.

\notetext{new-ethics}{Jesus's new ethics}
\notesummary{Among the synoptic gospels, almost all of Jesus's novel ethical teachings are contained only in the sermon on the mount
(or the shorter sermon on the plain), and not in the (likely earlier) gospel of Mark.}

If a little green man from outer space were to read the gospels, not having any previous cultural indoctrination, he would 
say that Jesus's focus was solely on preparing for the end of the world, and had almost nothing to say about ethics beyond
stern reminders to follow the preexisting Mosaic Law. If Mark and John were specific individuals, then evidently their entire picture
of the new religion contained almost nothing worth recording in terms of new moral teachings.

Don't judge other people: Matthew 7:1. (The story of the woman taken in adultery in John 8 contains
a similar message, but most scholars think it was a later addition.)

No divorce: Matthew 5:31. Its duplication (with somewhat different legalistic conditions) in Mark 10:10 is the
only clear exception to the rule.

Legalistic: Don't get involved in lawsuits, and don't swear oaths.

Emotional: Peace; forgiveness; turn the other cheek; love your enemies; anger is sinful. Lust is sinful.

Antimaterialism: This is not really novel but more a continuation of John the Baptist's teachings: a less extreme version
of John's asceticism, along with a belief that
material gains were useless since the end of the world was coming. Mark 10:21-25 have a similar antimaterialist
message, but seem like a clear later interpolation rather than anything Jesus would have said, since they include
the admonition to ``follow me, taking up the cross.''

\notetext{jesus-ethics-conduct}{Jesus's ethical example contrasted with the sermon on the mount}
\notesummary{He set a moral example in his itinerant lifestyle ministry, but his conduct is sometimes inconsistent with
the wisdom sayings presented in this sermon.}

Jesus is sometimes violent (Mark 11:15, the assault on the moneychangers in the Temple),
angry (Mark 1:41, anger with the leper), and in his religious displays sometimes ostentatious (Mark 11:9, the entrance
into Jerusalem).

\notetext{kingdom-summary}{Summary of material about the kingdom of God}\index{kingdom of God!summary}
The following is my own amateur analysis, from an atheist and naturalistic perspective.
See the debate at the end of ch.~2 of Beilby for a discussion by experts that covers similar ground and expresses
many possible permutations of contradictory opinions.

Jesus and his followers live in a theocracy, not a liberal democracy with separation of church and state.
They have no way even to conceptualize a political revolution without a religious one, or
a religious one with no political side. It must be either both of these things or neither.
The ``neither'' possibility won't wash, especially after Jesus's violent physical assault on
the Temple in Jerusalem.
Revolution is in the air, and will in fact happen in 66 CE with the First Jewish-Roman War.

They anticipate some great change in the institutions of power, but they don't believe
that the coming of the kingdom of God is only this. John the Baptist's ministry was both
a symbolic military reconquest of the promised land (crossing the Jordan) \emph{and}
a ritual to symbolize repentance and the cleansing of people's hearts (Josephus, p.~\pageref{josephus-baptism}).
Jesus's ministry has the same dual purpose.
He wants his followers to repent and purify themselves (as he himself did with John), then
start building their utopia from the ground up (Thomas 113/Luke 17:20), and
by doing so strengthen themselves and practice how to complete the transformation (Thomas 98).\footnote{If the
mythicized version of Jesus's temptation in the desert in Luke 4 contains any authentic residue of Jesus's
thoughts on these matters, then it makes sense that he rejects the devil's offer of temporal power. The political revolution
has to be based on the right religious foundation.}
This connection between spiritual worthiness and worldly dominion is inevitable given the
familiar cyclical logic of the Hebrew bible, with the human race repeatedly losing and
regaining God's favor.\footnote{\reftex{Luke 17:25-32}, whether spoken by Jesus or written by the evangelist,
explicitly makes the comparison to Noah's flood.}

How fast is all this going to happen? If Jesus wants to build a movement, he can't say that
it will come to its final fruition next week, nor can he excite his followers by saying that
it might take thousands of years. He tells them that it is already underway in the changes
they are making at the personal and social levels (Thomas 113/Luke 17:20).

He does give a more specific timeline -- one generation -- in the synoptic gospels, but the context makes it
likely that this is the evangelists putting words in his mouth.
\reftex{Mark 8:27-9:1} is a Christian fabrication (with the telltale ``take up his cross''), at the end of which,
\reftex{Mark 9:1}, Jesus tells the messengers,
``\ldots there are some standing here who will in no way taste death until they see God's kingdom come with 
power.''\footnote{Similarly in \reftex{Matthew 16:27-28}, \reftex{Luke 9:26-27}.} We also have in \reftex{Mark 1:14}, as Jesus emerges from the wilderness
and embarks on his mission, ``The time is fulfilled, and God's kingdom is at hand! Repent, and
believe in the good news.'' But like \reftex{Luke 3:10} (p.~\pageref{john-social}),
this seems to me to be an attempt to harmonize John's teaching with Jesus's (\notewithoutbackref{john-social}).
A need for repentance was not one of Jesus's themes in general.\footnote{Cf.~Funk, p.~41 re the authenticity of this saying,
and Vermes, p.~269, who tries to pick the verse apart into authentic and inauthentic parts.}

Meanwhile, Jesus will at some point start planning his own timeline.
Taking the sequence of events in Mark at face value, the one-generation statement in Mark 9
comes quite close in time to his suicidal actions in the Temple in 
Mark 11.\footnote{They are separated by perhaps six months if we take seriously the kind
of calendrical gymnastics done in Robertson, A harmony of the gospels, pp. 85 and 152.}
Jesus has already seen his mentor John the Baptist destroyed by the regime, simply
for being a dangerous rabble-rouser (p.~\pageref{john-the-baptist-death}).
He has no wish to get his own followers massacred by the Romans, but at whatever point
in time he forms his plan of action at the Temple, he knows that it will almost certainly
result in his own death. He doesn't need to be a prophet or have a time machine in order
to predict when this will happen.

\notetext{john-loaves-and-fishes}{John's account of the loaves and fishes, and the Passover}
\reftex{Mark 6:30} describes the miracle of the loaves and fishes, which is recapitulated in \reftex{Mark 8:1-38}.
John embellishes Mark's account. John implausibly has
Jesus, before feeding the crowd, first lead them from the seashore up into the mountains, seemingly in order to make the occasion more impressive.
\reftex{John 6:4} also identifies the day as the Passover, which implies that everyone is disregarding their obligation to make a pilgrimage to
the Temple in Jerusalem. The absence of this verse in the Minuscule 472 manuscript suggests that this was a later invention meant to
add a theologizing preview of the last supper.

          This usually seems to show up in the form of a botched elaboration at the end of

\reftex{Mark 5:14-20} presents the aftermath of the Gadarene swine story, p.~\pageref{gadarene-swine}, in a scramble of
reactions that are hard to account for except possibly as a mixture of feelings by different people at different times. Most likely
the confusion and illogic occur because of the clumsiness of an editor in appending a story of the proselytization of Jesus's teachings

For other analyses, see Chilton, p.~171, and Vermes, pp.~400-401.\label{gadarene-aftermath}

\reftex{Luke 4:28-30} presents a luridly dramatized story of Jesus narrowly escaping ritual execution in Nazareth.
This violent episode, which is absent from Mark, is the last of a series of seemingly incoherent
interactions between Jesus and the Nazareans in the synagogue. First they wonder at his gracious words;
then they either insult his paternity (in Mark) or don't (in Luke). Luke then goes off the rails.
Jesus anticipates and responds to
a proverb that the crowd hasn't actually mentioned, and which in context questions his sanity; then Jesus,
for no apparent reason, escalates by implying that he is a prophet and they are not real Jews; and finally
they attempt to throw him off a cliff; but he, ``passing through the middle of them,'' simply goes on his way.

Matthew has an agenda of inflating the sizes of the crowds surrounding Jesus. When he copies a story from Mark,
he often adds his characteristic phrase ὄχλοι πολλοὶ, literally ``many throngs,'' or in the WEB translation ``great multitudes''
(Matthew 4:25, 8:1, 8:18, 12:15, 13:2, 15:30, 19:2). This results in garbling at the end of the story of the leper,
in which \reftex{Matthew 8:4} has Jesus give the command of secrecy as in Mark, which doesn't make
sense because Matthew has placed the scene in the middle of a huge crowd.

Mark Goodacre has explained a number of examples such as the Matthean crowd/secret garbling as
arising from ``editorial fatigue,'' and uses them to support the hypothesis of Marcan priority.

\notetext{dogs}{Dogs}
The metaphor of dogs is at the heart of the most central difficulty in interpreting the meaning of the historical
Jesus's teachings.

The tanakh's references to dogs are uniformly negative. They are scavengers, dangerous, and  ritually unclean:

\bible{Exodus 22:31}{
You shall be holy men to me, therefore you shall not eat any meat that is torn by animals in the field. You shall cast it to the dogs.
}

\bible{Deuteronomy 23:19}{
You shall not bring the wages of a harlot or the price of a dog to Yahweh's house for any vowed offering, for
both of these are an abomination to Yahweh.
}

% My translation, based on interlinear: https://biblehub.com/interlinear/deuteronomy/23-18.htm
% WEB translates dog as "male prostitute."

\bible{1 Kings 14:11}{
The dogs will eat he who belongs to Jeroboam who dies in the city; and the birds of the sky will eat he who dies in the field, for Yahweh has spoken it.” ’
}

\bible{Psalms 22:16}{
For dogs have surrounded me. A company of evildoers have enclosed me. They have pierced my hands and feet.
}

This attitude does not seem to have changed until long after the time of Jesus.
In the mishnah and mystical traditions, dogs are treated as a threat and as a metaphor for demons.

% https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/judaism-dogs/

Gentiles had more positive attitudes about dogs. For example, Marcus Aurelius (Meditations 6.16.3) approvingly describes:

\begin{quotetext}
\ldots the vineyard worker, the colt breaker, and the dog trainer \ldots
\end{quotetext}

But in Hellenistic culture, describing a person as a dog was a different matter. When a woman was uppity or unchaste,
she was traditionally described in ancient Greek culture as being a dog. For example, in Odyssey 18.338,
the promiscuous Melantho scolds Odysseus, who replies by calling her a dog and threatening dismemberment.

Greek has four words for dog: κύων (classical and koine, dog), σκύλαξ (classical, puppy),
κυνάριον (classical and koine, a diminutive meaning a puppy\footnote{Euthydemus 298d} or
small dog\footnote{Cyropaedia 8.4.20: ``In the first place,'' he answered, ``she must be short, for you are not tall yourself, and if you married a tall maiden and wanted to give her a kiss when she stood up straight, you would have to jump to reach her like a little dog.''}), and σκύλος (modern, dog).

In the new testament, ``dog'' is always an ethnic slur against the gentiles.

\matthew{7:6}{
Don't give that which is holy to the dogs.
}

\bible{Philippians 3:2}{
Beware of the dogs; beware of the evil workers; beware of the false circumcision.
}

\matthew{15:22}{
Behold, a Canaanite woman came out from those borders and cried, saying, ``Have mercy on me, Lord, you son of David! My daughter is severely possessed by a demon!''

 But he answered her not a word.
His students came and begged him, saying, ``Send her away; for she cries after us.''

 But he answered, ``I wasn't sent to anyone but the lost sheep of the house of Israel.''

 But she came and worshiped him, saying, ``Lord, help me.''

 But he answered, ``It is not appropriate to take the children's bread and throw it to the little dogs.'' 

  But she answered him, ``Yes, lord. Yet even the little dogs under the table eat the children's crumbs.''

Given the dual overlays of Jewish and Hellenistic culture,
the implication for Matthew and Mark's Greek-speaking readers is probably not that Jesus likes puppies but rather
 a brutal slur, something like ``the dirty little gentile b\textendash\textendash\textendash\textendash{}es.''
The gentile woman is transgressing by bringing her uncleanliness into a Jewish household, as well as by
verbally accosting Jesus, who is trying to hide. In the subsequent exchange, she cleverly turns the slur to her sick daughter's benefit
and becomes the only person in the gospels ever to beat Jesus in an oral argument.


\notetext{jesus-entering-jerusalem}{Jesus entering Jerusalem}
Jesus would have been in Jerusalem many times before on festival pilgrimages,\footnote{as recognized by Luke in \reftex{Luke 2:41}}
but this is the dramatic climax of the gospel story, and \reftex{Mark 11:1-11} has Jesus making this entrance triumphantly.\index{Jerusalem!entrance into}

Up until now, both Jesus and his mentor John the Baptist have carried out a mission far from the centers of power, in the Perean
wilderness and at whistle-stop towns in Galilee. John's execution came not from a conflict with the Romans, the Temple in Jerusalem,
or the ruler of Judea Herod Archelaus, but for being a threat to public order (p.~\pageref{john-the-baptist-death})
in the jurisdiction of Herod Antipas, which covers Perea and Galilee. Jesus is rumored to be the messiah, which would
be a threat to Roman rule and its client theocracy in Jerusalem, but he has never made the claim publicly, and those
at the centers of power have probably never heard of him. Even decades later, Josephus's account (excluding the forgery in
Antiquities 18-3) portrays Jesus as at most a footnote compared to John.

There has been a lot of scholarly debate about whether Jesus's movement was revolutionary, and, if so, whether it was
in any way directed against the Romans, or whether it was against the client theocracy. The account given by the author
of Luke/Acts explicitly analogizes Jesus to other failed movements, and shows that there was plenty of room for ambiguity
in the eyes of the council when the messengers were brought before them:

\bible{Acts 5:33}{\label{gamaliel-acts}\index{Gamaliel the Elder}
But they, when they heard this, were cut to the heart, and were determined to kill them.   But one stood up in the council, a Pharisee named Gamaliel, a teacher of the law, honored by all the people, and commanded to put the messengers out for a little while.   He said to them, ``You men of Israel, be careful concerning these men, what you are about to do.   For before these days Theudas rose up, making himself out to be somebody; to whom a number of men, about four hundred, joined themselves. He was slain; and all, as many as obeyed him, were dispersed and came to nothing.   After this man, Judas of Galilee rose up in the days of the enrollment, and drew away some people after him. He also perished, and all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered abroad.   Now I tell you, withdraw from these men and leave them alone. For if this counsel or this work is of men, it will be overthrown.   But if it is of God, you will not be able to overthrow it, and you would be found even to be fighting against God!''
}

\notetext{tomb}{Historicity of Jesus's tomb}
\notesummary{In Mark 15:42-47, Jesus is entombed with the help of a rich man who intervenes with Pilate. This is almost
certainly a fabrication.}

Precisely because people in the ancient world considered a decent burial to be so important,
part of the punishment of crucifixion was to be left out to be eaten by dogs and crows.\footnote{Crossan, p.~160}

There is historical and archaeological evidence for exceptions to this rule. Josephus says:\footnote{The Life of Flavius Josephus, 75}

\begin{quote}
\ldots I saw many captives crucified, and
remembered three of them as my former acquaintance. I was very sorry at
this in my mind, and went with tears in my eyes to Titus, and told him
of them; so he immediately commanded them to be taken down, and to have
the greatest care taken of them, in order to their recovery; yet two of
them died under the physician's hands, while the third recovered.
\end{quote}

% http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2846/pg2846.txt

Furthermore, an archaeological dig in 1968 uncovered an ossuary containing the remains of multiple people,
with an inscription reading Jehohanan.\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jehohanan}}
 One of the heel bones has a nail through it. This verifies that
it was possible for the remains of a crucified person to be interred. However, we have no idea of the
circumstances of this person's interment. For example, it's possible that he was left out as carrion and then
thrown in a mass grave, with his family then extracting what was left. For opposing views on what this tells us about Jesus's possible tomb,
see blog posts by Ehrman\footnote{\url{https://ehrmanblog.org/the-skeletal-remains-of-yehohanan-readers-mailbag-october-8-2017/}}
and Evans.\footnote{apparently no longer online}

Since a lack of a decent burial was part of the punishment, and Jesus was crucified as an enemy
of the state, it would be extremely surprising for his remains to be released to one of his supporters as described in the gospels.
Any of his supporters, even a rich one, would have been tainted by association with a political criminal,
not treated with consideration as Titus did with Josephus, a Roman citizen and loyal comrade who had renamed
himself Titus Flavius Josephus after his patron and his patron's dynasty. Josephus's reasons for recording
this incident would be that (1) it is so incredibly unusual as to be interesting to his readers;
(2) it depicts his patron as just and merciful; and
(3) it show that Josephus is the kind of important person who can call in this type of favor (which is also
the message of the longer passage in which this incident occurs).
None of these three factors are likely to be present in Jesus's case. His execution for sedition was
routine. Pilate was remembered as brutal and efficient, not kind and merciful. And Jesus was exactly
the opposite of the sort of politically connected person represented by Josepus.

\notetext{resurrected-appearances-reality}{Reality or unreality of the resurrection experiences}
The NT records that Jesus appeared, resurrected in the flesh, to a number of his followers, and that,
just as the women were the only ones to remain with him during the crucifixion, women were the first to see him resurrected.

There is no a priori reason to disbelieve that
Jesus could have cured some cases of what we would today call mental illnesses and psychosomatic illnesses, and likewise
no reason for rejecting the possibility that Jesus's followers could have had real psychological
experiences in which they witnessed him resurrected. The case for the latter, however, seems much weaker.

The details of the times and places of Jesus's post-resurrection appearances are inconsistent in the
different accounts, as is the list of which witnesses are present when. Therefore we can't necessarily
judge whose ecstatic experiences actually happened using only criteria such as internal consistency
or historical possibility, time, place.

If anything, Jesus's appearances to his female followers are the most
reliable, despite being described in connection with the historically unlikely tomb. Women were not considered reliable witnesses,
and if it had not already been popularly believed that they were the first to see a post-crucifixion vision, before the messengers or any other men, the
evangelists would have been unlikely to invent such a thing. (Paul edits the women back out in 1 Corinthians 15:3.)
But the women in Mark 16:1-8 do \emph{not} see Jesus resurrected in the flesh, only a young man in a white robe,
who they are too afraid to tell anyone about, despite his command to do so.

Once this account circulates in the scattered and distraught community of Jesus's former followers,
it has to be embellished and made theologically correct. Men have to be included, in the account in
\reftex{Mark 9-20} that is added in later manuscripts. This had better be Jesus, not just a man in white robes
(\reftex{Matthew 28:8}). It has to be clarified that this is not just
a ghost, because that would be too ordinary (\reftex{John 20:24}). Anyone who wants to compete to inherit the
leadership of the movement had better have his own vision (\reftex{1 Corinthians 15:7}).

Supporting this picture is the fact that resurrection visions sometimes contradict other clear
statements Jesus made while alive, even within the same gospel, as in Matthew 28:19.

This interpretation requires that almost all the people who described these appearances were
consciously lying, which is hard to square with the feeling that
``liars make bad martyrs.'' We have several cases in which the
witnesses are well-identified historical people, martyred for their
beliefs. These include Peter, Paul, and Jesus's brother James.
Clement I says that Paul was martyred Nero and implies the same about Peter, while Josephus says that James was
sentenced by the Sanhedrin to death by a ritualized Jewish punishment,\footnote{The prescription was to throw the person from a high place, possibly
followed up by stoning, \notewithoutbackref{false-prophecy-executation}. Accounts of the details differ in James's case.} during a gap in Roman
oversight between two procurators. We have no reliable contemporary mention of the exact circumstances of Peter or Paul's deaths, however.
We do have Peter lying repeatedly after Jesus's arrest, although it's the
opposite sort of lie. And Paul is a slippery and self-aggrandizing character who
is frequently dishonest (p.~\pageref{paul-tinkering}).
It is not hard to imagine Peter and Paul believing that the religion they were building was
so valuable that it was worth dying for, but also worth lying for. And given general Roman customs in these cases, there is no reason
to imagine that Peter or Paul could have escaped execution merely by admitting that they had fabricated accounts of resurrection
visions. Based on accounts such as Pliny's (p.~\pageref{pliny}), they would have only been able to survive if they had
made much more fundamental gestures of apostasy, such as cursing Christ and worshipping a statue of the emperor.

\notetext{paul}{Biographical sketch of Paul}\index{Paul!biographical sketch}
Paul was a diaspora Jew from Tarsus, a Hellenistic city on the south coast of today's Turkey.
He was born around the same time as Jesus and was a leather worker and tent-maker.
His family was of the tribe of Benjamin, and he was a Pharisee and persecuted Christians
until his miraculous conversion at Damascus.

He had an Aramaic name, Saul, and a Greek one, Paul, and he was comfortable in both
these languages.\footnote{He is described in \reftex{Acts 21:40} as speaking ``Hebrew,'' but from context this means Aramaic,
the language of his audience.}
We don't know which was his milk tongue. His writing style in Greek was colloquial and punchy.
As a man with one foot in each culture, he was perfectly positioned to transform the
teachings of Jesus, the obscure Galilean Jew, into a gentile religion.

Paul's epistles are the first written records of Christianity. He appears to have had knowledge of
Jesus's ethical teachings, since his ethical advice mostly agrees with the later gospel sources.
But there are specific contradictions (p.~\pageref{paul-contradicts-gospels}), as well as a completely
different big picture. For Jesus, the main point is to obey (and extend) the torah in anticipation of
the kingdom of God, whereas Paul is creating an entire new religion in which sins are
forgiven by Jesus's sacrifice. Paul seems to have had
no access to any of the specific sayings of Jesus recorded in the gospels, which may only have been
circulating at that time in oral Aramaic form, in Galilee. No otherwise attested original sayings of Jesus are ever quoted in the Pauline
epistiles.\footnote{Price, in Beilby, p.~67.}
Some of Paul's information about the religion may have come from his Christian relatives Andronicus and Junia,\footnote{\reftex{Romans 16:7},
``Greet Andronicus and Junia, my relatives and my fellow prisoners, who are notable among the messengers, who were also in Christ before me.''}.
He did eventually meet other apostolic figures such as Peter and Jesus's brother James, but
by his own account, his knowledge of Christianity is not from them but was instead
received directly from God, in a vision:

% https://books.google.com/books?id=kmWlKKB_iYgC&pg=43#v=onepage&q&f=false

\bible{Galatians 1:11}{
But I make known to you, brothers, concerning the good news which was preached by me, that it is not according to man.   For I didn't receive it from man, nor was I taught it, but it came to me through revelation of Jesus Christ.   For you have heard of my way of living in time past in the Jews' religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the assembly of God and ravaged it.   I advanced in the Jews' religion beyond many of my own age among my countrymen, being more exceedingly zealous for the traditions of my fathers.   But when it was the good pleasure of God, who separated me from my mother's womb and called me through his grace,   to reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the gentiles, I didn't immediately confer with flesh and blood,   nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were messengers before me, but I went away into Arabia. Then I returned to Damascus.
  Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to visit Peter, and stayed with him fifteen days.   But of the other messengers I saw no one except James, the lord's brother. 
}

When his presentation of himself in the epistles is evaluated based on naturalistic
and historical criteria, Paul comes off as dishonest and self-aggrandizing. By these
criteria, his direct communication with God is not believable. He claims to be a Roman citizen, but
this is very unusual for a Jew, and is argued to be ``scarcely credible'' by Koestler for
a variety of historical reasons.\footnote{Introduction to the new testament, volume 2, p.~107}
The author of Luke/Acts quotes Paul in \reftex{Acts 22:3} as saying that he had studied with a great rabbi in Jerusalem, the premier religious leader of
that generation, but Paul never makes this claim in his own epistles, and it isn't plausible.\footnote{Koestler points out that
since the rabbi, Gamaliel the Elder,\index{Gamaliel the Elder} was liberal and tolerant (see p.~\pageref{gamaliel-acts}), it wouldn't make sense for Paul to
persecute the Christians so rabidly if he was Gamaliel's student. For historical details, see Maccoby, pp.~51-57.}
He claims to be a formidable linguist (\reftex{1 Corinthians 14:18}), but his frequent quotations from
the Hebrew bible, when not inaccurate or fabricated, are based on the Greek-language septuagint.\footnote{For example,
\reftex{1 Corinthians 15:55}:
``Death, where is your victory [νῖκος]? Death, where is your sting [κέντρον]?''
This is based on the septuagint's version of \reftex{Hosea 13:14},
``Death, where is your punishment [δίκη]? Hades, where is your sting [κέντρον]?''
The Hebrew version quotes an angry Yahweh, who makes a long series of threats, in the course of which is:
``I will be death, your plague [debareka]. I will be sheol, your destruction [qatabeka].''
The question of Paul's knowledge of Hebrew is discussed in Maccoby, pp.~70-71.}
He compares his education favorably with that of the messengers (\reftex{2 Corinthians 11:5}).

Paul's concern is to arrogate authority to himself, and this authority is transmitted, through him, from two
sources: the Hebrew bible and direct revelation from God.
He never cites Jesus's actual words, since these had not yet been
codified and made authoritative in the gospels. 
Just as a very large proportion of Jesus's words in the gospels are actually quotes or paraphrases from scripture,
Paul spends a great deal of time citing the Hebrew scriptures (which very few
Christians would have been able to access in writing, and which in many cases he tinkers with\footnote{For example,
compare \reftex{Romans 10:11}, `For the Scripture says, ``Whoever believes in him will not be disappointed,'' '
with \reftex{Isaiah 28:16}, ``He who believes shall not act hastily.'' 
See C.D.~Stanley, \emph{Paul and the language of scripture}, p.~33.}\label{paul-tinkering}).

% copy of Stanley hoarded in stanley_paul_and_the_language_of_scripture.pdf

Paul took Jesus's brand of Judaism and proselytized it to the gentiles, something Jesus
and his Jewish Galilean followers never contemplated during his lifetime, nor was it
pursued actively by the other two main leaders of the early church, Peter\footnote{In \reftex{Galatians 2:11},
Paul upbraids Peter as a hypocrite for refusing to eat with gentiles.} and James, the brother of Jesus.
Although Paul was not one of the twelve messengers commissioned by Jesus, he claimed for himself the title
of ``messenger to the gentiles'' (\reftex{Romand 11:13}).
He traveled widely and went through considerable danger and abuse.
Paul was an energetic writer of epistles to the early Hellenistic church, and tried to settle disputes such
as what should happen when a Christian was married to a non-Christian.
His claims of authority were contested by Peter and Jesus's brother James (\reftex{Galatians 2:11-12}).

Like Jesus, Paul accepted women as important leaders. 

Paul is traditionally said to have been martyred under Nero by decapitation around 64-68 CE, but these accounts
date from a centuries after that date.

\section*{Translations}

In general, English translations of the bible are derived from the public-domain World English Bible (WEB), often unchanged.
However, I've freely made changes for reasons of style or clarity; to provide more vivid or familiar language
(e.g., ``brood of vipers''); to eliminate revertial capitals; to correct language that I think is historically
inaccurate (e.g., for τελώνιον, ``toll booth'' rather than WEB's ``tax office''); to make the text more readable after my own elisions; and, in some
cases, for substantive reasons, such as my own interpretations of what is meant by ``son of man'' in various contexts.
The translators of the WEB ask that people not describe altered versions of the text as the WEB.

Translations of Josephus are from Whiston, 1737.
The translation of the Didache is by Robertson and Donaldson, with language modernized by me.
The translation of Philo is by Yonge.
Translations of the Gospel of Thomas are  by Thomas Paterson Brown (1938-2012),
a counterculture figure who uploaded his translations of the gnostic gospels onto a university web site
in Greece around 2000. Most verses of Thomas begin with ``Jesus said''
and end with ``Whoever has ears, let him hears,'' but I have usually omitted these for readability.\label{brown-trans}
