  "notes":"Also στεναχίζω, στενάχω. Beekes considers these all to be etymologically unrelated to στενός, narrow, and στείνω, to be crowded. Phrases such as στένω κῆρ would thus mean simply to groan in one's heart. Cunliffe believes that στείνω, στένω, and στεναχίζω carry the connotation of both groaning and fullness, so that στένω κῆρ could imply both a moaning and a fullness of the heart, 'to give audible vent to' the feeling of fullness.",
  "etym":"PIE sten-, groan.",
