  "word":"ἐξερέω",
  "medium":"fut: declare",
  "long":"fut: declare. A near synonym of ἐρέω used in a certain set phrase or variations of it: ὧδε γὰρ ἐξερέω, τὸ δὲ καὶ τετελεσμένον ἔσται·, 'For this I declare, and it shall be accomplished.' The literal English translation 'speak out' (or 'speak out openly,' LfgrE) is inaccurate because the speaker is often speaking from a position of power (Iliad 2.257), and sometimes secretly (Iliad 1.212). The sense of ἐξ- here seems to be that the act of speech is irrevocable: once the words are 'out there,' they can never be taken back, so the speaker is making a commitment.",
