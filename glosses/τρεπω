  "word":"τρέπω",
  "princ":"τρέψω,ἔτρεψα/ἔτραπον",
  "medium":"turn",
  "cog":"trophy, Atropos, entropy, tropic, stophe",
  "notes":"1st aorist ἔτρεψα, 2nd aorist ἔτραπον. Cf. μετατρέπω, to change something into something. The cognates familiar to English speakers are all o-grade and have to do with the idea of a 'turning' as a change or transformation of one thing into another, as in 'He turned into a frog.' The more superficially similar word trepan is actually from τρυπάω, to bore or drill, which is from an unrelated PIE root. There are actually two PIE roots like 'trep,' one meaning to tremble and one to turn."
