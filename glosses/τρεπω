  "notes": "There is no difference in meaning between the 1st aorist ἔτρεψα and 2nd aorist ἔτραπον. The passive meaning, including 'to change one's mind' and 'to turn oneself around,' is expressed with the middle voice in Homer. Cf. modern μετατρέπω, to change something into something. The cognates familiar to English speakers are all o-grade and have to do with the idea of a 'turning' as a change or transformation of one thing into another, as in 'He turned into a frog.' The more superficially similar word trepan is actually from τρυπάω, to bore or drill, which is from an unrelated PIE root, although it would seem logical that a drill turns. There are two PIE words 'trep,' one meaning to tremble and one to turn. 'Trophy' comes from the idea of turning an enemy. Of the three fates, 'Atropos' is the one who could not be turned from her inexorable determination of the manner of one's death.",
