  "notes":"Beekes says that people disagree on the details of the semantic connection, with some saying it's something like 'most helpful' and others that it's like 'physically strongest.' As expected from the etymology, the word is used to describe someone's inherent qualities rather than his position of power. Cf. κράτος/κρείσσων, which can refer as well to mere possession of power."
