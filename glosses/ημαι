{
  "word":"ἧμαι",
  "medium":"sit, lie",
  "syn":"κάθημαι, ἕζομαι, ἵζω, modern κάθομαι",
  "etym":"From the same PIE root as English 'is.' PIE s regularly vanishes in Greek when found between vowels, giving for a stem simply η-. The aspiration is explained away as being an imitation of ἕζομαι and ἵζω.",
  "notes":"Used for senses such as 'to be situated.' The only tenses are the perfect ἧμαι, used for the present, and the pluperfect ἥμην, used in place of the imperfect. Ἕζομαι (poetic) has present, imperfect, and aorist tenses, and means specifically 'seat oneself.'"
