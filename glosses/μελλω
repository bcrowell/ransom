  "notes": "The etymology is unknown. Not the same word as μέλω, to be of concern. May be from PIE roots such as mel (strong, e.g., ameliorate), mel (hesitate, e.g., Old Irish mall), mel (limb, e.g., μέλος), or melh3 (go, μωλεῖν). Not from PIE mel (soft, e.g., mollify, μαλάκας) or melh2 (grind, e.g., meal, mellow).",
