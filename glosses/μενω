  "word":"μένω",
  "princ":"μενέω,ἔμεινα",
  "medium":"stay, wait, remain",
  "cog":"μίμνω, remain",
  "notes":"There is also a reduplicated form μίμνω with a mostly overlapping set of meanings, but connoting something more like 'to stand firm.' There are two PIE roots men, the other one having to do with the mind. The additional phonetic similarity between 'remain' and forms like 'μεῖναι' seems coincidental."
