  "word":"ἀλεγίζω",
  "medium":"care about, heed",
  "etym":"Possibly cognate with λέγω, which can be linked to a Proto-Italic root lego with the the meaning 'to care.' Beekes doubts this connection on phonetic grounds.",
  "cog":"If cognate with lego, then also related to English words such as diligence, negligence.",
  "notes":"Ἀλεγίζω and ἀλέγω are both epic, have similar meanings, and are both normally negated and used with the genitive (ἀλεγίζω always so). Ἀλεγίζω exists only in the present and imperfect, ἀλέγω only in the present. The positive or other tenses can be expressed with κήδω, μέλω."
