  "notes":"The sense 'flat' is not present in Homer, and 'wide' is much more commonly expressed using εὐρύς. Homer uses πλατύς mainly to describe extensive flocks of livestock. 'Flat' can be expressed using ὁμαλός, λευρός, and possibly χθαμαλός, but these are all uncommon."
  // So how does Homer say 'flat' in most cases?
  // Buckley uses 'level' 6 times as an adjective, could see what Greek words these are.
