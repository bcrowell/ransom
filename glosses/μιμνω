  "notes":"Occurs in poetry, from Homer to Euripides. Only the present and imperfect exist, the other tenses being provided by μένω, the form without reduplication. The meanings are nearly identical, but μίμνω has more of a connotation of 'stand firm,' 'withstand.' Other pairs of verbs with and without reduplication are πίπτω/πέτομαι and ἴσχω/ἔχω.
