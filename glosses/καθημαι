  "word":"κάθημαι",
  "medium":"sit",
  "syn":"ἕζομαι, ἧμαι",
  "etym":"κατα + ἧμαι",
  "notes":"Somewhat less common than ἕζομαι in Homer. Cunliffe gives a broader list of senses for ἕζομαι, but the meanings of the two words seem to overlap quite a bit. Κάθημαι describes strictly the state of being in a seated position, sometimes with the implication of idleness."
