  "word":"ἵζω",
  "princ":",ἕσσα",
  "medium":"to seat",
  "etym":"PIE *sed, 'sit'",
  "cog":"sit, ἕζομαι",
  "syn":"κάθημαι, ἕζομαι, ἧμαι",
  "notes":"Ἕζομαι (poetic) is more specifically 'seat oneself,' whereas ἵζω can be either transitive or intransitive. Ἵζω is not the active of ἕζομαι, which would be the nonexistent ἕζω, but ἕζω is the etymology of the aorist ἕσσα. The synonym ἧμαι has perfect and pluperfect tenses ἧμαι and ἥμην that are used as present and imperfect. The future of the intransitive is expressed using ἕζομαι."
