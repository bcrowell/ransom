  "notes":"Modern λέγω. The Homeric conjugation in the present indicative active is φημί φῄς φησίν/φασίν  φαμέν φατέ    φασίν. All of these except for φῄς are enclitic. Common past tenses are 3s φάτο and ἔφαθ᾽ and 1s ἐφάμην. The aorist form ἔφησα listed in dictionaries does not occur in Homer. Φημί + inf. usually, but not always, signifies 'to think.' The future φήσω is essentially absent in Homer. Does ἐρέω do its job?",
