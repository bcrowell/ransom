  "medium":"[will] declare",
  "notes":"The extremely common form in Homer is ἐρέω, used in speech to mean I [will] declare. The present tense ἐρῶ is a fictional dictionary forms. (Project Perseus usually lemmatizes it as ἐρῶ, but in the rare present as ἐρέω. Cunliffe and Cambridge lemmatize it as εἴρω.) Although the verb is used in the future tense, there is no real future meaning in usages such as ἀλλ ̓ ἔκ τοι ἐρέω (Iliad 2.257), 'But I declare to you.' In Attic, λέγω is the verb for 'to say,' and it lacks a future tense, which ἐρέω supplies.",
