  "notes": "The aorist of 'to see' is expressed using the verb εἶδον, but that verb's future and perfect mean to know. The contraction α+ε=α gives imperfect ὅρα. Most senses have the same meanings in active and middle. There is a passive in attic (to be seen), but not in Homer. The imperative ἰδέ is one of five 2nd aorists that accent the final syllable.",
