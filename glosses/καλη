  "word":"κάλη",
  "medium":"=καλός",
  "notes":"Project Perseus lemmatizes the elided form κάλ᾽ as κάλη, which seems mysterious to me since it's normal for an accent to shift in this way (Smyth sec. 175). Cunliffe confirms that this is just a form of καλός, e.g., using Iliad 3.89 as an example of his sense 4."
