  "long": "transitive: stand, set, assemble, station, moor, weigh; intransitive: stand, be at a location, be initiated, halt, stand firm, stand idle, be appointed",
  "notes": "The transitive senses are expressed with the active voice, including the first aorist (ἔστησ-). The intransitive is expressed with the 2nd aorist (ἔστη-) and perfect (ἕστηκα). (The 3pl ἔστησαν is the same in 1st and 2nd aor.) As usual when a verb has both 1st and a 2nd aorist, the 1st aorist means to cause the action (stand something in place, cause it to stand), while the 2nd is to do the action. The transitive of the verb ἵστημι itself is fairly iuncommon, but there are many compounds such as ἀνίστημι. Re the notion of 'to weigh,' compare στατήρ. For 'assemble,' there is also συνίημι. The main transitive verb meaning to put or set something in place is τίθημι.",
