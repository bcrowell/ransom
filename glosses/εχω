  "word": "ἔχω",
  "princ": "ἕξω,ἔσχον",
  "short": "have",
  "medium": "have, hold, hold back",
  "notes": "When a person possesses a thing, it is very frequent to express this using εἰμί+dat. rather than ἔχω. Note the aspiration of the future ἕξω. Ἕξω expresses the aspect of 'I will have;' there is a separate future form σχήσω that is 'I will get.' The reduplicated form ἴσχω means 'restrain, hold back,' but ἔχω itself can also mean this, as in Iliad 2.275. Homer uses the poetic aorist ἔσχεθον in place of the regular ἔσχεν about half the time, and likewise in the compounds ἀνέχω, κατασχεθεῖν, ὑπερέχω, and ὑπέχω.",
  "cog": "scheme, sketch, Hector, school, σχεδόν, σχέτλιος"
