  "notes":"This verb most often seems to function simply as a plug-in alternative to εἰμί, possibly chosen just to fit the meter. See, e.g., Iliad 6.434, where Homer composes a parallel construction using ἐστι and ἔπλετο. There is usually no special connotation of 'turning out.' Most usages are the four 3s forms πέλει, πέλεται, πέλεν, and ἔπλετο. The mp ἔπλετο, is especially common. The mp has the same meaning as the active, and is somewhat more common.  The inflections that have the form of the imperfect tense actually function as if they were the aorist and sometimes have present meaning (Iliad 2.480; see Monro, p. 38, sec. 33). When the augment is used, ths stem drops its vowel and becomes ἔπλ-.  Compounds ἀμφιπέλω, ἐπιπέλομαι, περιπέλομαι."
