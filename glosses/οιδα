  "word":"οἶδα",
  "medium":"know, know of (+acc)",
  "notes":"There is no present tense, only perfect, pluperfect, and future. Most forms have εἰ- or ᾔ-. The perfect is a mix of forms that resemble οἶδα and others like ἴσασιν. Participle εἰδώς, εἰδυῖα, εἰδός. The pluperfect, epic ᾔδεα, is used as the imperfect. Future εἴσομαι. Οἶδα is the only verb in Greek whose perfect does not show reduplication or lengthening of a vowel.",
