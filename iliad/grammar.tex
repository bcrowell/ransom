\formatlikesection{Itty bitties}

What I mean by an ``itty bitty'' is a short word that contributes disproportionately to confusion.
Many of the following words are two or three letters, and many are among the ten or twenty the most common
words in the Homeric dialect. Many are verbal particles, clitics, or postpositives.

A \emph{particle} is a word that has no meaning of its own and changes the meaning of other words.
A \emph{clitic} is a word that gets controlled phonologically by other words, leaning (κλίνω) on them. In Greek,
clitics lack an accent, although they are listed with one in dictionary entries. 
They consist of \emph{proclitics} that lean on the following word, and
\emph{enclitics} that lean on the preceding word. Articles and prepositions are enclitics.
A \emph{postpositive} is a word that comes after the word that it modifies, as in ``someone nice.''
